CHAPTER III
Budget
Section I-General
301. Budget - A Constitutional and Management Document -Article 112(1) of
the Constitution of India prescribes that 'the President shall in respect of every financial
year cause to be laid before both the Houses of Parliament a statement of the
estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of India for that year‘ referred
to as the "annual financial statement" and popularly called the "Annual Budget".
Though the constitutional requirement is only that the 'financial statement' shall contain
a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditure for the coming financial year, as
a matter of practice, every budget contains three elements-
a) a review of the preceding year, including the actual receipts and
expenditure in that year;
b) an estimate of the receipts and expenditure of the coming year; and
c) proposals, if any, for meeting the requirements of the coming year.
Though the Constitution does not provide for the presentation of the annual financial
statement or Budget in parts, the Rules of Procedure of Parliament have provided that
'nothing shall be deemed to prevent the presentation of the Budget to the House in two
or more parts and when such presentation takes place, each part shall be dealt with in
accordance with the rules as if it were the Budget'. This provision had enabled the
Separation of the Railway Budget from the General Budget and the passing of separate
Appropriate Acts for each of these Budgets in keeping with the Separation Convention
(1924). With effect from 2017-18, Railway Budget has been merged with the General
Budget and hence the Demand for Grant and the Statement of Budget Estimates of
Ministry of Railways has become an integral part of the General Budget presented by
the Finance Ministry.
302. Voted and Charged Expenditure -Article 112(2) of the Constitution prescribes
that the estimates of expenditure embodied in the annual financial statement shall
show separately-
a) the sums required to meet expenditure charged upon the Consolidated
Fund of India ; and
b) the sums required to meet other expenditure proposed to be made from
the Consolidated Fund of India.
3

The expenditure proposed in the Budget may, therefore, be either (i) Voted. or (ii)
Charged. Article 113(1) of the Constitution provides that 'the estimates of expenditure
charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India shall not be submitted to the vote of
Parliament'. There is, however, no restriction on either House of Parliament discussing
any of these estimates, where after funds are sanctioned by the President.
Article 113(2) requires that estimates of voted expenditure "shall be submitted in the
form of demands for grants to the House of the People (Lok Sabha) and the House of
the People shall have power to assent, or to refuse to assent, to any demand, or to
assent to any demand subject to a reduction of the amount specified therein".
Article 113(3) enjoins that no demand for a grant shall be made except on the
recommendation of the President.
303. Charged Expenditure -In respect of Railways, the following expenditure is
"charged" on the Consolidated Fund of India-
i) The salary, allowances and pension payable to or in respect of the
Comptroller and Auditor General of India;
ii) Any sums required to satisfy any judgement, decree or award of any Court or
awards by Arbitrators where made into rule of court; and
iii) Any other expenditure declared by the Constitution or by Parliament by law
to be so charged.
304. Apart from its significance as an instrument of Parliamentary financial control,
the Budget is an important management tool. Broadly the financial forecast in the
Budget is related to the performance targets set for Railway Administrations, and it is
the responsibility of the Railway Managements to ensure the achievement of these
associated targets.
305. Demands For Grants
The proposals of Government in respect of sums required to meet expenditure from the
Consolidated Fund of India are to be submitted in the form of "Demands for Grants" to
the Lok Sabha. The Demands shall be for gross expenditure; the credits or recoveries
(vid paragraph 335) being shown in the form of footnotes to Demands.
306. Pursuant to the recommendations of Railway Convention Committee 1971, a
Task Force was constituted by the Government in July 1973 to examine certain aspects
4

of budgetary, accounting and management practices on the Railways. In their First
Report the Task Force made recommendations for the restructuring of the Formats
and Contents of Demands for Grants and the manner in which the Railway Budget
should be prepared. The recommendations made by the Task Force alongwith
Government's decisions thereon have been considered by the Estimates Committee
(1978-79) (Sixth lok Sabha); and the Formats and Contents of Restructured Demands
for Grants effective from 1st April, 1979 and as further modified with effect from FY
2017-18 after merger of Railway budget with Union Budget are given in Annexure I.
There is a single Demand for Ministry of Railways after merger of Rail Budget with
Union Budget with effect from FY 2017-18.
The salient features of restructured Demands for Grants are as under :-
i) The single Demand for Grant is classified into Revenue and Capital
Segments. The Grant is divided into various Major Heads and in case of Revenue
Segment Major Heads are further divided into various Sub Major Heads (SMH).
ii) Expenses are broadly grouped by activities as an aid to developing
budgets and analysing actual expenses against budgetted expenses.
iii) Each Major Head/Sub Major Head has two-way classification by activity
and by Primary units of expenditure. The activity classification identifies 'why' an
expense item is incurred. The behavior of costs in relation to changes in traffic
volumes at each activity location thus provides a data base for revising the
budget in response to changing volumes of output. The primary unit (object) of
expenditure on the other hand, identifies 'what' the expense item denotes, i. e.,
by way of labour, materials etc. Such a breakdown facilitates concurrent cost
and budgetary control for it pin points the types of expenses on which the
organisational unit should concentrate to improve its performance. The primary
units also indicate the categories of expenses that would be used by any
organisational unit to prepare its budget and monitor the variances from the
norms set up by it.
iv) The Budget classifications have been completely aligned with the
Accounting classifications.
The system is simple in structure and is intended to exploit fully the capabilities
of IT Applications such as IPAS etc. to analyse revenue expenses by activities for
management /parliamentary reporting and by primary units for expenditure
control at the responsibility cost centres where the expenditure is incurred. For
Works Expenditure, the classification provides a direct link-up with the Plan
heads.
The functional orientation of both the Budgetary Demands for Grants and the
5

accounting classification ensures a complete concordance between the sub-
heads of the Demand for Grants and minor heads of accounting classification on
the one hand and the detailed activity classification of the Demands for Grants
with the Sub heads of Accounting Classification on the other.
v) Ministry of Railways is required to lay the Detailed Demands for Grants in
Lok Sabha after the General Budget is presented to Parliament.
Major Head wise details of Zonal Railway-wise/Spending Unit is circulated among
Railways for their working.
The Detailed Demand for Grants and the Zonal wise break-up of Detailed
Demand of Grants will have the following sub divisions:
a) Minor Heads of the Sub Major Heads representing major
functions/activities.
b) Sub heads representing a further break-up of the activity of
classification i.e. identifying ‗why‘ of the expenditure in greater detail.
c) Primary Units (Objects of Expenditure) identifying 'what' the
expenditure denotes i.e.—
Salary
Wages,
Allowances
Materials
Contractual Payments, etc.
vi) The activity classification combined with the accounting by primary units of
expenditure provides a built-in mechanism for isolating fixed costs like general
administration and permanent sanctioned labour from variable and semi-variable
costs like cost of materials, cost of temporary labour, travel expenses, incentive,
running allowances etc. The scheme is however, by no means such as to
correlate expenditure directly with units of performance.
307. The authorities responsible for control over expenditure against budget provision
in each Major Head/Sub major Head are given in Annexure I.
For the laying of the Detailed Demands for Grants (preparation of the Budget) by the
Ministry of Railways (Railway Board), the Railway Administrations and other authorities
empowered to incur expenditure are required to submit to the Railway Board their
revised estimates for the current year and budget estimates for the following year.
Since the Railway Budget is finalized by the Ministry of Finance (MoF), the Budget
6

calendar being followed by Railways has to be in line with the schedule notified by the
MoF. For finalizing the Revised Estimates /Budget Estimates, MoF hold discussions with
various Ministries/Departments from middle of October to first week of November.
In view of the above, Revised Estimates for the current year and Budget Estimates for
the next year need to be finalized by the Board by mid of October itself. Accordingly,
the Revised Estimates/Budget Estimates are required to be submitted to the Board as
per the due dates and procedure:
Revenue Section (Major Head 3001, 3002 & 3003) (Sub 20th September
Major Head 1 to 11)
Estimates for Traffic Plan and Revenue Receipts (Major 20th September
Head 1001, 1002 & 1003)
Civil Estimates/Demands 20th September
Capital Section (Major Head 5001 & 5002) 25th September
Note -Timeline given above is subject to change as per the instructions issued by
Railway board every Year.
The revised estimates are required in respect of the current year and Budget Estimates
for the following year. The forms in which the estimates should be prepared are
furnished each year by the Railway Board to the authorities concerned and the
instructions for the filling up of the forms are printed on the back thereof. A list of the
Budget Forms is at Annexure II.
308. Glossary of terms used-The following is a glossary of the terms which the
Railway Administrations should use in their estimates and other connected documents.
The terminology given in the glossary should be followed uniformly by all Railway
Administrations and no departure should be made therefrom in any circumstances:
Glossary Of Terms
i) Coaching Revenue (less refunds)
ii) Goods Revenue (less refunds)
iii) Traffic Revenue = (i)+(ii)
iv) Sundry Revenue (less refunds)=Other than Traffic Revenue
v) Gross Revenue = (iii)+(iv) = true or accrued Revenue in an accounting period whether or
not actually realised.
7

vi) Traffic Suspense.
vii) Gross Receipts = (v)+(vi) =
Revenue actually realised during an accounting period.
viii) Miscellaneous Receipts = Guarantee recoverable from State Governments + Other
Miscellaneous Receipts, such as Government share of surplus profits, sale of land of
subsidized companies, receipts from surcharge on Passenger fares, etc.
ix) Total Revenue Receipts = (vii)+(viii).
x) Ordinary Working Expenses = Expenses booked under final heads, excluding appropriation to
Depreciation Reserve Fund, and Pension Fund. (Payments on account of accident
compensation and Pensionary Payments should also be excluded).
xi) Appropriation to Depreciation Reserve Fund.
xii) Appropriation to Pension Fund.
xiii) Gross Working Expenses = (x)+(xi)+ (xii) = True expenses in an accounting period whether
or not actually disbursed.
xiv) Suspense.
xv) Gross Expenditure = (xiii) + (xiv) = Working Expenses actually disbursed during an
accounting period.
xvi) Miscellaneous expenditure = Surveys + Land for subsidized companies; subsidy + other
Miscellaneous Railway expenditure, Appropriations to Pension Fund relating to Railway Board
and Miscellaneous establishments booked under Major Hear 3001 and payments to worked
lines.
xvii) Total Revenue Expenditure = (xv)+(xvi).
xviii) Net Revenue = (v) - (xiii).
xix) Net Receipts = (ix) - (xvii).
xx) Payments to General Revenues (Deleted)

Note. The "Surplus or Shortfall" shown in item (xxi) differs from the "gain or loss" given in Account
No. 110 of the Finance and Revenue Accounts of the Government of India, as, the former
takes into account all the Miscellaneous Receipts (viii) and Expenditure. (xvi)
attributable to a Railway, whereas the latter does not.
Section II -Preparation Of Budgets By Railway Administrations.
309. Responsibility for framing the Estimates - Preparation of the Revised and
Budget Estimates should commence at the 'grass root level ‘, i.e., Division, Workshop,
Stores Depot etc., as the case may be. The entire responsibility for framing the
estimates devolves upon the spending/earning authorities concerned, though the actual
8

work of compilation and scrutiny would rest with the Financial Advisor & Chief Accounts
Officer who would also draw the attention of the General Manager to matters of purely
financial import.
310. The estimates should be as accurate as possible and, to achieve this object, care
should be taken to see that the data on which the forecast is based is adequate and
reliable and that the conclusions arrived at from the data can be sustained by past
experience and future expectations of likely events.
311. No stereotyped method of estimating will be helpful in forecasting accurately,
unless the data on which the forecast is based is selected with due care and all the
useful knowledge is brought to bear on the conclusions to be derived from the data.
The manner in which the data required for the preparation of the estimate should be
collected is, therefore, left to the General Managers, but the general principles on the
basis of which the various estimates should be framed are described, wherever
necessary, in the following paragraphs.
312. The Revised and Budget Estimates should be framed by the various concerned
authorities in keeping with the instructions given below separately for-
i) Gross Receipts ;
ii) Ordinary Working Expenses;
iii) Payments to Worked Lines ;
iv) Appropriation to and expenditure to be met out of Railway Funds ;
v) Works Expenditure ; and
vi) Civil Estimates
Gross Receipts
313. The estimates of Gross Receipts are required in the format given in the form
(item (1) of Annexure II) and should be submitted after compilation in the Budget
Module in IPAS or accounting software, the various figures being given in thousands of
rupees. Information should be furnished in accordance with the instructions printed on
the reverse of the form (item (1) of Annexure II). Two sets of the estimates of
Revenue should be prepared, one on the basis of originating Revenue and the other
with reference to apportioned Revenue. The two sets of figures should be sent to the
Railway Board both for the Revised Estimates for the current year and the Budget
Estimates for the following year.
9

314. Coaching Revenue: Revenue from each class of passenger traffic viz., Air
conditioned , First and Second, should be estimated on the basis of passenger
kilometres and the average fare per passenger kilometre for each class separately. The
Revenue from parcels traffic should be estimated in the same way as for goods traffic,
and from military traffic should be assessed on the basis of the previous actuals and
the influence of changing conditions in the future. The Revenue from coaching traffic,
other than passenger, parcel and military traffic, may be estimated on the basis of a
ratio of the Revenue from passenger traffic to be determined with reference to the
previous actuals.
315. Goods Revenue- Estimate for the commodities which, yield the bulk of the
Railway's revenue, should be based on the anticipated net tonne kilometres (NTKM) to
be carried, and the average yield per NTKM, for each commodity. The Revenue from
the rest of the commodities should be assessed in lump sum, based on the trend of
events in the immediate past, the experience of the past years and, so far as it is
possible to ascertain, the influence of changing conditions in the future.
316. Sundry Revenue -The miscellaneous Revenue of a railway is derived mainly from
the following sources:-
i) Operating loss of strategic lines as reimbursed by Ministry of Finance
ii) Rent and tolls ;
iii) Commercial Publicity;
iv) Land Lease, Land Monetization/Property Development;
v) Right of way for OFC laid by/for Rail Tel & Right of way /way leave facility
for others;
vi) Receipts from car/scooter/cycle parking at stations/Railway premises;
vii) Advertisement fees & Non-Fare Revenue activities;
viii) Catering;
ix) Sale proceeds of grass and trees, damaged goods and unserviceable
revenue scrap; and
x) Interest and maintenance charges on account of assisted sidings, saloons,
postal vehicles, etc.
xi) Other Misc. Sundry Revenue
The Revenue from these sources is comparatively small and should be estimated on the
basis of previous actuals and any other circumstances that may be known or foreseen
at the time.
317. Receipts of Worked Lines –The receipts of worked lines should be included in the
10

receipts of the main lines under the several sub-heads and also the total should be
shown separately in the estimates.
318. Refunds of Revenue –The figures of refunds of revenue should be
deducted from the estimated receipts under each sub-head and the figures for
gross receipts should be given net (after deduction of refunds).
319. Explanation of variations in receipts - The estimates should be accompanied
by a brief narrative explanation of the figures of actual Revenue for the first seven
months of the current year, especially if they show any pronounced change from those
for the corresponding period of the preceding year. For example, if the Revenue from
second class traffic have risen or fallen markedly, the narrative explanation should state
what, in the General Manager's opinion, is the reason for so large a change in the
number of passengers carried or the average distance travelled by them; if goods
traffic in certain commodities has been exceptionally brisk or dull, the commodities
affected should be specified, and so on. Similar explanations should be given of the
figures adopted by the General Manager for the revised estimate for the remaining
period of the current year, and for the budget estimates for the ensuing year.
320. The estimates of Revenue under each category should be shown separately for
"local" and "interchanged" traffic and an analysis furnished indicating the trend of
realisation in the current year as compared to the previous year. It must be ensured
that figures for interchanged traffic take into account the latest position of both
"outward" and "inward" transactions and the period upto which the revenue has been
realised should, also be indicated. The Railway-wise details of the realisations/
anticipated realisations, indicating also the period upto which these relate, should be
furnished. Judicious and purposeful use should be made of the periodic statement of
approximate Revenue on originating basis as well as of the monthly digest of current
trends in economic conditions of Railway Transport circulated to the Railway
Administrations by the Director, Statistics and Economics, Railway Board.
321. The estimates of originating goods traffic (in tonnes) based on the actuals of the
first five months and expectations for the last seven months of the current year should
be given separately for (i) traffic moved to and from the steel plants by principal
categories (other than coal) such as raw materials, finished products like steel
manufactures, pig iron and alloy steel, (ii) Coal for Steel Plants, Washeries, and other
users, (iii) Cement, (iv) Export ore, (v) Fertilisers, (vi) POL products, (vii) Food grains,
and (viii) General Goods. The increase/decrease anticipated in the originating tonnage
11

during the current year over that of the preceding year under each of the categories of
goods traffic mentioned above should also be given specifically in a statement annexed
to the Revenue estimates. The annexure to the Revenue Estimates (item (2) of
Annexure II) indicating certain selected commercial and operating statistical data for
the purpose of establishing a better link between the estimates of revenue and working
expenses, should be completed in all respects and sent with the estimates of revenue.
Additionally, the approximate amount of increase in Revenue due to the opening of
new lines, as well as the consequent increase on existing lines, should be stated, as far
as possible, separately for the information of the Railway Board.
322. Variations under Passenger, Goods and Other Coaching Revenue on account of
the effect of increase/adjustments, if any, in fares and freights as compared to the
increases provided in the Budget Estimates for the year should be separately explained.
The revised estimates of Revenue should, therefore, have a proper correlation to the
latest traffic anticipations as revealed from the originating, cross and received traffic
figures.
323. Review of Traffic Outlook - These explanations are required not only to
enable the Railway Board to judge whether the estimates are reasonable, but also to
assist them in explaining them to the Parliament. What in fact is wanted from the
General Manager is a very brief review of the traffic outlook for the current and
ensuing years which can be used for assessing the total traffic prospects of the
Railways. The actual form in which this brief review should be rendered each year is
left entirely to the discretion of the General Manager; the Railway are particularly
desirous that it should not be stereotyped.
Ordinary Working Expenses
324. The estimates of Working expenses required from Railway Administrations are
so arranged that Minor Heads of Sub major Heads 01 to 13 of Major Heads 3002,3003
as detailed in Annexure I, are in alignment with minor heads of Railway Accounting

Note -The years have been given for the purpose of Illustration only. Also after
implementation of Budget Module on IPAS or any other accounting software, only the
projections pertaining to RE and BE is being submitted to Railway Board through IPAS
Budget Module or accounting software.
325. The estimates of expenditure in respect of each Sub Major Head should, be
submitted after compilation in the Budget Module in IPAS, the, figures being given in
thousands of rupees. In preparing their estimates the Railway Administrations should
ensure that the figures of actual expenditure for the preceding year shown in the
estimate agree with those reported to the Railway Board. The figures of actual
expenditure for the current year should represent the latest data.
15

326. Explanation of variations -A brief narrative explanation should be given of the
causes (with amounts involved in each case) of substantial differences between the
figures adopted for the revised estimate of the current year and (i) the actuals of the
previous year, and (ii) budget allotment for the current year. Similar explanation
should be given for differences between the figures of the budget estimate of the
ensuing year and the revised estimate of the current year. Large variations which
compensate each other should also be indicated.
327. The revised estimate for the current year and the budget-estimate for the
next year should be fixed after taking into account the expenditure of the previous
year and comparing the expenditure during the first five months of the year with the
corresponding period of the previous year. A full explanation of special features and
any exceptional and abnormal adjustments (with amounts involved) included in each
period of the previous and current year as also in the next year, should be given in the
explanatory note accompanying the estimates. The financial effect of variations on
account of specific reasons should be clearly brought out under each Sub Major Head
as shown in the statements (Items 58 to 64) of Annexure II.
328. When the expenditure anticipated in the last seven months of the year is
disproportionate as compared with (i) the first five months of the year or (ii) the
corresponding period of the previous year, reasons for the disproportionate expenditure
should be given in the revised estimate. Special and non-recurring items of expenditure
in a year should show a corresponding saving in the following year. Likewise, when
transfers are made from one Sub Major Head to another due to changes in
classification, the saving shown under one Sub Major Head should agree with the
excess shown under the other Sub Major Head.
329. Estimate of Cost of Establishments- In working out the cost of
establishments, the Railway Administrations should not make any meticulous
calculations of the emoluments to which individuals will be entitled if they continue to
hold the posts during the year. The estimates of the cost of establishment should be
based on past experience of their actual cost, with due allowance for any changes
either in the number or rates of pay of each individual establishment in the year in
which, or for which the estimate is being made.
330. In the explanatory note accompanying the estimate, information should be given
as to what part of the proposed expenditure represents expenditure on the permanent
staff already sanctioned, how much of the proposed increase in the next year is due to
16

ordinary increments, how much is new expenditure and how much for temporary
establishment. Reasons should be given for additional staff when provision is made in
the estimates for such increase in expenditure. The estimates of ordinary working
expenses should be accompanied by 'Staff Statements' under each Sub Major Head in
the proforma given in items, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 41 and 43 of Annexure II.
Explanations for substantial variations in the numbers should be furnished as between
current year's budget and, revised estimates and budget estimates for the following
year.
331. Suspense Heads -The estimates in respect of revenue suspense heads (viz.,
Demands Payable and Misc. Advances-Revenue) should be prepared by the Financial
Advisor & Chief Accounts Officer on the basis of past actuals and current trends.
Budget for Demands payable is for the net increase or decrease in the balance at the
end of the year, while for Misc. Advances the budget requirement would be on a 'gross'
basis.
332. Repairs and Maintenance Expenditure of Rolling Stock -The budget and
revised estimates of expenditure on repair and maintenance of Rolling Stock separately
by locomotives (steam, diesel and electric), carriages, wagons and other coaching
vehicles included in Sub Major Head (SMH) 03 and 04 should be supported by

Funds is budgeted, whether for appropriations to or expenditure from the Funds, and
the source of finance for each, are given in the table below :-

7) Railway Debt 3006 (SMH 12) Appropriation from 3002 & 3003
Service Fund Excess(Surplus) after
( 8116) appropriation to Development

As may be seen from, column 3 of the foregoing Table, the Funds are financed from
internal resources of the Railways.
339. Except in the case of Pension Fund for which the Revised and Budget Estimates
are prepared by, and appear in the Budget Statements of the individual Railway
Administrations, the responsibility for framing the revised and budget estimates for the
other railway funds with the Ministry of Railways (Railway Board) (see para 305). The
estimate amount of appropriation to the Pension Fund is based on actuarial calculations
to provide for the liability arising from pensionable service rendered by Railway
employees for varying periods. Where such actuarial calculations are not completed,
the appropriation is made on an adhoc basis to be suitably re- assessed in due course.
340. The Budget estimate for appropriation to the Depreciation Reserve Fund (DRF) is
based on the replacement programme including arrears of depreciation, if any, to be
made good during the following year. Such an estimate is really not an isolated
exercise only for the purpose of the annual budget but is a part of the overall resources
planning of the Railways.
341. Similar position obtains, by and large, in respect of the Development Fund.
However, the Railway's Revenue surplus envisage in the Plan, out of which these funds
21

are financed, may undergo considerable change due to various factors affecting Railway
operations. A fresh assessment of the surplus if any, to be appropriated to this fund
has, therefore, to be made in the Revised and Budget Estimates.
342. Even though the estimate of appropriation to the Depreciation Reserve Fund is
prepared by the Railway Board, the amount finally fixed is distributed over the Railways
on the basis of the Capital Outlay of each railway at the end of the previous year as
shown in the Finance and Revenue Accounts of the Government of India. The estimate
shows separately the amount actually contributed to the Depreciation Reserve Fund in
the accounts of the previous year, the figures of budget and revised estimates for the
current year, and the budget estimates for the following year.
343. As regards the estimate of expenditure to be met out of the Railway Funds, the
table in para 338 shows that so far as DRF and DF are concerned, the expenditure
under Capital Segment is budgeted as part of the Railway‘s Works Machinery and
Rolling Stock Programme (see paras 346 et seq.). The budget/revised estimates for Sub
Major Head 11-Pensionary charges- Pension Fund are prepared by the individual
Railway Administrations taking into account the pensionary charges payable during the
year to pensionable Railway Employees. The estimates relating to safety and Customer
Amenities Works are prepared by the individual Railway Administrations on the basis of
the funds requirement of Safety and Customer Amenities Works specified in this behalf.
344. Deleted
345. After merger of Railway Budget with Union Budget, no payment is to be made to
General Revenues from 2017-18 onwards. Transfers to Funds, such as National
Investment Fund, Central Road and Infrastructure Fund and Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha
Kosh are controlled by Ministry of Finance.
346. Works, Machinery and Rolling Stock Budget -The revised and budget estimates
for expenditure on construction, acquisition, and replacement of assets (briefly known
as the Works Budget), are prepared in the form of the Works, Machinery and Rolling
Stock Programmes. Detailed instructions for the preparation and submission of the
Rolling Stock Programmes and the Machinery and Plant Programme are contained
in Chapter X of Indian Railway Rolling Stock Code. The Works Programme is
required to be prepared in accordance with the instructions embodied in Chapter VI
of the Indian Railway Code for the Engineering Department.
347. Capital Expenditure for Works is classified under Major Head 5002 - Capital
Outlay on Indian Railways-Commercial Lines ,5003- Capital Outlay on Indian Railways-
22

Strategic Lines (erstwhile Demand no. 16), irrespective of whether expenditure is
charged to the Capital , the ‗Depreciation Reserve Fund', the 'Development Fund', the
‗Railway Safety Fund‘, the ‗Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh‘ or ‗Extra Budgetary
Resources‘. Works Demand provides for booking of expenditure by various Plan heads
and for the purpose of link with the accounts of Central Government, the Plan heads
form the Minor Heads of Railway Works/Capital Expenditure, under the Major Heads
5002 & 5003. Minor heads of classification also refer to Plan head code. The list of Plan
Heads is as follows :-
Code number of Description of Plan Head
Plan Head
11 New Lines
14 Gauge conversion.
15 Doubling.
16 Traffic facilities-Yard remodelling and others.
17 Computerisation
18 Railway Research
21 Rolling Stock.
22 Leased Assets-Payment of Capital portion of lease charges to IRFC etc.
29 Road Safety Works – Level Crossings
30 Road Safety Works – ROB/RUB
31 Track renewals.
32 Bridge works, tunnel works and approaches
33 Signalling and Tele-communication works.
35 Electrification projects.
36 Other Electrical works including TRD works
41 Machinery and Plant.
42 Workshops including production Units.
51 Staff Welfare
53 Customer Amenities
61 Investment in PSU/JV/SPV and others etc. ( Government & Non-Government)
64 Other specified works.
65 Training/HRD
71 Stores suspense.
72 Manufacturing suspense.
73 Miscellaneous Advances.
81 Metropolitan Transport Projects
82 Transfer to Special Railway Safety Fund (RRSK)
The source of financing is indicated by the following numeric codes while booking of works
expenditure under the Revised Classification:-
20-Capital
23

21- DRF
23- DF I, 33-DF II, 43–DF III, 53-DF IV
26 – Railway Safety Fund
29- Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh
83- EBR(IF)
'Works Expenditure' of the Railways is thus financed from, Railway Funds (DRF, DF),
Railway Safety Fund, Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh and Capital provided by the
General Revenues. The upper limit on the ‗Works Budget‘ of the Railways is, therefore,
determined by the resources allocation under various well-defined Plan heads, such as
New lines construction, Rolling stock, Electrification Projects, Traffic Facilities,
Investment in Road Service and Commercial Undertakings, Metropolitan Transport
Projects and Inventories, etc Within this allocation of resources, the Railway
Administrations are required to make out their programmes, duly vetted by the
Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts officer for submission to the Railway Board by a
specified date. The programmes are examined by the Railway Board and discussed,
where necessary, with the General Managers before finalising the revised and budget
estimates in respect of the Works, Machinery and Rolling Stock programmes.
348. Inventories -The revised and budget estimates for inventories viz. store in
stock, works-in-process in workshops and production units, other stores transaction
such as purchase, sales and Miscellaneous Advances (Capital) are all part of Capital
Outlay on Indian Railways-Commercial Lines/Strategic Lines
(Major Head 5002&5003. -Assets Acquisition, Construction and Replacement) The value
of the inventory under these heads is held as part of the Railways' Capital Investment.
The revised and Budget Estimates for the inventories depend on various factors. Even
though budgeted under Capital Segment, the operation of the inventories in Zonal
Railways depends almost entirely on the revenue operations as budgeted under the
various Sub Major Heads for Ordinary Working Expenses. In Production Units, however,
the inventory budget has to be closely linked with the manufacturing operations budget
which, in turn, will be dove-tailed with the Rolling Stock Programme. Detailed
instructions for the Preparation of the budgets for stores transactions and manufacture
operations are contained in Chapter XXXI of the Indian Railway Code for the Stores
Department and Chapter X of Indian Railway Rolling Stock Code respectively.
349. Civil Demands-To enable the Ministry of Finance to incorporate the
requirement of and /or information relating to the Ministry of Railways regarding staff
24

advances and other transactions which form part of the General Budget, the Railway
Board has to obtain from- the Railway Administrations for transmission to the Ministry
of Finance a number of statements. These are dealt with below.
350. Income tax, Interest on Advances by Central Government and Interest on Debt
and other Obligations -The estimates of income-tax and interest should be submitted in
the form at Annexure III.
351. Debt Heads and K-Deposits and Advances -These estimates are required by the
Railway Board in the form at Annexure IV.
352. K-Deposits and Advances and F-Loans and Advances, by the Central
Government-The revised and budget estimates of advances should he submitted to the
Railway Board in the form at Annexure V.
353. Remittance Transactions -The estimates of remittance transactions should be
submitted to the Railway Board in the detail shown in form at Annexure VI .The
estimates should be framed, as far as possible, in conformity with those of the other
party to the transaction, and wherever there are any important differences which it is
not possible to reconcile the differences should be specifically mentioned in the
explanatory notes to the estimates.
Section III-Compilation And Scrutiny Of Budget In The Railway Board
354. The estimates of working expenses submitted by individual railways are
subjected to a critical examination by the Railway Board and, after taking all the
relevant factors into consideration, the Railway Board frame their own estimate of the
expenditure likely to be incurred during the year.
355. The procedure adopted by the Railway Board in fixing the allotment for each
railway is as follows: The Revised Estimate for the current year is first fixed under each
Major Head for each railway, after taking into account the expenditure for the
preceding year and comparing the expenditure during the first seven months of the
current year with the corresponding period of the previous year, full consideration
being paid to the special feature of both years. Having thus fixed the revised estimate
for the current year, the budget estimate for the next year is prepared on a
consideration of the special circumstances so far as known, of both years. The amounts
provided for individual railway administration are restricted as nearly as the Railway
25

Board can assess to their actual need, consistent with the exercise of the most rigid
economy.
356. The estimates of expenditure on rolling stock, plant and machinery, structural
and other engineering works (i.e., programmes of rolling stock plant and machinery
and works) submitted by the railways, after having been carefully examined by the
Railway Board as to the necessity and justification of the works included therein, are
discussed with the railway administration and the work to be undertaken during the
Budget year decided upon. The programmes as finally settled after discussion form the
budget estimates of railways for expenditure to be incurred during the following year
on new constructions and open line works chargeable to Capital, Capital Fund,
Depreciation Reserve Fund, Development Fund., Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh,
Railway Safety Fund and Extra Budgetary Resources.
357. Submission to the Minister -The estimated amount required for Capital
expenditure during the next year is intimated to Ministry of Finance for necessary
provision being made in the ―Way and Means‘‘ budget of the Government of India and
after it has been ascertained from Finance Ministry that funds will be available to meet
the estimated expenditure, the programmes are submitted to the Minister for approval.
358. The rolling stock and plant and machinery programmes, as approved by the
Minister, are subject to further modifications which may subsequently necessary due to
one or other of the following causes: -
i) If any item of rolling stock and plant and machinery ordered for delivery in
the current year is not delivered before the end of the year and remains unpaid,
it becomes necessary to provide money in the programme for the next year for
such items as will be delivered in that year.
ii) Later information may suggest alterations in the estimated prices at which
the stock can be purchased.
iii) When, owing to the early date on which the programmes are prepared, other
modifications may be found necessary during the course of the year.
Of the proposed modifications, the important ones, if any, are, however,
specifically brought to the notice of the Minister before the presentation of the
Budget to the Parliament. The estimates of working expenses as fixed by the
Railway Board each railway and those of expenditure on works, plant and
machinery and rolling Stock as finally settled, are consolidated under the
respective Major Heads/Sub Major Heads detailed in paragraph 306 and
26

submitted to the Minister before submission to the Ministry of Finance.
359. Deleted.
360. Appropriation Bill - Pursuant to Article 114 (1) of the Constitution, after the
Demands for Grants have been voted by the Lok Sabha, there shall be introduced a
Bill to provide for the Appropriation out of the Consolidated Fund of India of all moneys
required to meet the grants so made by the Lok Sabha and the expenditure, If any,
charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, but not exceeding in any case the amount
shown in the Statement previously laid before the Parliament. The Appropriation Bill as
passed by the Parliament and assented to by the President forms the basis for
budgetary allocation to the different Ministries including Railways.
Section IV - Administering The Budget
361. Distribution of Funds by the Railway Board-The Grants as voted by the
Parliament and the appropriation for the charged expenditure as sanctioned by the
President are distributed by the Railway Board among the railway administrations and
other authorities subordinate to them, as soon as possible, after the Budget is
sanctioned. The sums so distributed are called "Allotments" and the orders by means of
which the allotments are made are called "Budget Orders". The allotments made out of
funds voted by the Parliament are shown as "Voted" and those fixed by President are
shown as "Charged".
362. Along with the Budget Orders ―Detailed Demand for Grants, Major Head wise
details of Zonal Railways/Spending Units and Works, Machinery and Rolling Stock
Programmes (Pink Book) is made available" to the railway administrations for working
expenses and Capital expenditure. The Budget allotment made to a railway
administration is intended to cover all charges, including the liabilities for past years,
to be paid during the year or to be adjusted in the accounts for it. It shall be operative
until the close of the financial year. Under the 'doctrine of lapse', any unspent balance
shall lapse and shall not be available for utilization in the following year.
363. In the event of the Budget Orders from the Railway Board not being received
before the commencement of the financial year, the railway administrations are
empowered to incur expenditure, pending the receipt of the Budget Order, on works
which were in progress at the end of the previous financial year. All expenditure
incurred under this rule must be treated as a charge against the allotments eventually
made for such works.
27

364. When the Budget Orders issued by the Railway Board show any reduction in
the estimates originally submitted to them, prompt measures should be taken by the
railway administrations to limit the expenditure to the amounts allotted and distributed
by the Railway Board.
365. Distribution of Funds by General Managers to Lower-Authorities -
Subject to the other provisions of this chapter, or of any general or specific orders
issued by the Railway Board, a General Manager is expected to take steps
immediately to distribute the funds, placed at his disposal, to authorities subordinate to
him in such manner as he may consider most suitable, provided that the total of the
sums so allocated does not exceed the total of the grant placed at his disposal. In
making this initial distribution, he may, at his discretion keep a sum unallotted as a
reserve for emergencies that may arise in future. He may also vary the initial
distribution as necessity arises during the course of the year. In regard to "Carry
Over" works, the latest information as to the necessity and extent of funds required for
such works should be obtained from the authorities concerned and taken into
consideration in making the initial distribution.
366. With respect to expenditure on works, the allotment made by the General
Manager to lower authorities shall, as for as possible, follow the lines of the Works,
Machinery and Rolling Stock Programmes issued by the Railway Board that is-
i) a specific sum shall be allotted by him for each item of rolling stock and for
each individual work estimated to cost over one lakh of' rupees. The General
Manager may also allot specific sums for other works for which he considers
desirable to keep separate accounts, i.e., above a certain minimum to be
prescribed by him,
ii) a lump sum shall be allotted by him for all work which are individually
estimated to cost less than the minimum limit prescribed by him.
iii) the conditions under which and the extent up to which authorities under him
may sanction re-appropriations between the sums allotted for individual works
shall be specified by him in making the allotment, and
iv) any reappropriation in excess of that admissible under clause (iii)from the
sum allotted for an individual work or any reappropriation from and to the lump
sum allotted under clause (ii) above shall require the prior sanction of the
General Manager.
The authorities to whom funds are distributed by the General Manager may,
subject to any general or special instructions issued by him, redistribute the
fund placed at their disposal to the authorities under them.
28

367. No expenditure shall be incurred by an authority without the allotment of
necessary funds. The authority to whom the funds are allotted, shall be responsible to
report at once to the next higher authorities the probability of any lapses or excesses
over the sums placed at their disposal. In exceptional cases where expenditure is
authorized in anticipation of the allotment of funds, or in excess of the existing
provision, the authorization should be followed, as soon as possible, by a formal
allotment of funds to the extent required.
368. The expenditure on each work shall be limited to the sum allotted for it. If for
exceptional reasons, expenditure in excess of Budget allotment has to be incurred
and if the authority incurring the expenditure is either not in a position to find funds
by reappropriation or is not empowered to sanction a reappropriation therefore,
application for additional funds shall be made to the next higher authority stating
how the expenditure is proposed to be met. In doing so it should invariably be
explained why the need for the expenditure was not foreseen in time for inclusion in
the budget and why the outlay cannot be postponed to the next financial year. In
each case a copy of the order making the allotment or sanctioning a
reappropriation shall be sent to the Accounts Officer concerned by the authority
issuing the order or sanctioning the reappropriation.
369. Responsibility of the Railway Board to avoid Excess over Grants or Expenditure
on a New Service/New Instrument of Service- It is the responsibility of the Railway
Board to ensure that the total expenditure against a grant voted by the Parliament or
appropriation sanctioned by the President does not exceed the amount of the grant
(including supplementary grants) or of the appropriations (Including supplementary
appropriations). They are also required to watch that the money voted by the
Parliament is spent on the purposes set out in the detailed Demand for Grants
presented to the Parliament and is not utilized for expenditure on New Service/New
Instrument of Service not voted by Parliament (see paragraph 382).
370. In pursuance of the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee,
presently New Works estimated to cost Rs. 250 lakhs or more each are treated as
―New Service/New instrument of Service‘. The term ‗New Service‘ has been held as
referring to expenditure arising out of a new policy decision, not brought to the notice
of Parliament earlier, including a new activity or a new form of investment. Likewise,
relatively large expenditure arising out of important expansion of an existing activity is
treated as ‗New Instrument of Service‘, which is a slight variant of the term ‗New
Service‘.
29

371. Responsibility of Railway Administrations in case of Excesses or Lapses
-The railway administrations shall be responsible to ensure that no expenditure is
incurred in excess of the Budget allotments made to them. Should it become apparent
at any time that the grant for the year is likely to be exceeded from any cause
whatsoever, the General Manager should report the position to the Railway Board and
apply for additional funds. No liability may be incurred in one year against anticipated
grants of a succeeding year except that advance commitments for procurement of
stores for works may be made as provided in para 812-S to the extent authorised by
the Railway Board from time to time.
372. It shall also be the duty of the administrations to see that the allotments made to
them are fully expended, in so far as is consistent with economy and the prevention of
large expenditure in the last months of the year for the sole purpose of avoiding
lapses. They shall be responsible for ensuring that money which is not likely to be
needed during the year is promptly surrendered so as to allow of its appropriation for
other purposes.
373. Powers of Railway Administrations in regard to emergent and
inevitable expenditure -Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 371 above, the
commencement of works urgently necessary to safeguard life or property or to repair
damage to the line caused by flood, accident, earthquake or other unforeseen
contingency, so as to restore or maintain through communication may be authorized by
the Executive Engineer; but he should at once submit a report through the usual
channel to the authority competent to give administrative approval to the work and to
allot the required funds.
374. Expenditure to meet a sudden increase in traffic or for ensuring the safe
operation of traffic may be incurred with the personal sanction of the General Manager
in anticipation of the allotment of necessary funds by the Railway Board provided that
the Financial Advisor & Chief Accounts Officer concurs. This power cannot be delegated
and can be exercised by the General Manager only where the expenditure is within his
powers of sanction. In all cases where this requires an allotment of additional funds, a
report showing the expenditure involved and the additional funds required should be
submitted to the Railway Board, as soon as possible.
375. Re-appropriations/Redistributions -The transfer of funds, originally
assigned for expenditure on a specific object to supplement the funds sanctioned for
another object is called "Reappropriation" or ―Redistribution‖.
30

376. Restrictions on Re-appropriations -Within the amount of a grant as voted
by the Parliament, the Railway Board have full power of transferring the provision from
one Sub Major Head/Sub-Head to another by a formal order of reappropriation.
However, Redistributions are not permissible between:
a) One Segment of the Grant ( viz. Revenue and Capital) and another
b) Voted and Charged allotment
c) One Major Head to another
d) One Source of Fund to another (i.e. between Capital, Railway funds,
Railway Safety Funds, Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh, EBR(IF) , EBR(IRFC-
Bonds) etc.)
e) One Railway Fund and another
377. Powers of Railway Administrations (i.e., Zonal Railways/PUs )-
i) Capital Segment
a) Full powers to redistribute among itemized Pink book works within
same plan-head and same source of fund, subject to original outlay
(BE) not getting reduced to less than Rs. 1 thousand.
b) Full powers to redistribute within ―LAW Book items‖ sanctioned
under Pink Book item of ―works costing below Rs. 2.5 crores each‖
(Lumpsum works)
c) Prior Approval of Railway Board is required in following cases:
1) Inter Plan head Redistribution
2) Redistributions from/to and among plan head 21 Rolling
Stock(Bulk Order) items
3) To/from and among works being executed by Rail Vikas Nigam
Limited (RVNL)
4) On portion of work constituting ‗Material Modification‘ which are
above Rs. 2.5 crores, if material modification pertains to current
year
5) For any redistribution under allocation Extra Budgetary
Resources (EBR), except EBR(IF)
6) To/from and among items declared as ‗National Projects‘ or
‗Projects of National Importance‘
ii) Revenue Segment
31

a) Full powers to redistribute within same Primary Unit under same
Sub Major Head
b) All other proposals of reappropriation to be sent to Railway Board
for consideration.
Above mentioned Delegated Powers of Railway Administration for redistribution may be
modified by Railway Board through the guidelines issued from time to time.
378. The amount allotted to the railway administrations under the Civil Grant for
"Interest on debt and other obligations and reduction or avoidance of debt" is
distributed under the following units of re-appropriations, viz :-
i) State Provident Funds,
ii) Railway Staff Benefit Fund,
iii) Eastern Group Sleeper Control Provident Fund,
iv) Depreciation Reserve Fund Railways,
v) Railway Development Fund,
vi) Pension Fund.
No reappropriation is permissible from one unit to another.
379. Other re-appropriations may be sanctioned by the, railway administrations but no
re-appropriations are permissible after the close of the financial year, i.e., 31st March.
The re-appropriations by railway administrations should not be, made haphazardly on
the basis of individual items of expenditure where the original provision is exceeded,
not should they be postponed to be made only towards the end of the year. The
railway Administrations should review the position as a whole at intervals and carry out
the necessary re-appropriations. When funds have to be provided for new expenditure
under one of the sub-heads and the administrations are definitely in a position to
transfer the grant from another sub-head for this purpose, the appropriations should be
made promptly. The whole object is to ensure that, as far as possible, funds which are
not required are withdrawn from disbursing officers as soon as it is definitely known
that they are not required, and incidentally to provide that any really unavoidable
expenditure is met from such savings as far as possible.
380. All proposals for reappropriation of funds which are beyond the General
Manager's powers shall be submitted to the Railway Board sufficiently early for
necessary action to be taken before the close of the financial year.
32

381. When orders are issued by the Railway Board authorising the railway
administrations to incur expenditure to a certain extent over and above the allotment
sanctioned for them, they should be taken as "expenditure orders" as distinct from
"Budget orders". No cognizance of these orders should be taken while sanctioning re-
appropriations or in distributing the sanctioned allotment over the various sub-heads.
Unforeseen Expenditure-Operation Of The Contingency Fund Of India
382. Unforeseen expenditure which cannot be met by reappropriation from the
existing grant and expenditure on a ―New Service /New Instrument of Service " not
contemplated in the budget, shall be met from out of the balance in the Contingency
Fund of India placed at the disposal of the Ministry of Finance.
383. Review of Expenditure- Finance Heads of all Railway Units should review their
expenditure booked on monthly basis.
For Revenue Segment comparison may be made Sub Major Head (SMH) wise and
Primary Unit (PU) wise with respect to Budget Grant, Proportionate Budget Grant,
Actual expenditure figures for Corresponding Period for Previous year or any other
metric deemed informative.
For Capital Segment, comparison may be made Plan Head wise, Source of funding wise
and individual work wise with respect to Budget Grant, Actual expenditure figures for
previous year or any other metric deemed informative.
384. Monthly Expenditure Review as done above should be shared with the heads of
all executive departments of that Railway Unit for their information and necessary
action. The review may also include the measures suggested that might be taken for
effective Budget Management.
385. Final -Modification Statement-The Railway Board should be furnished, for each
Major Head/Sub Major Head separately, so as to reach, Railway Board within the
prescribed date with statements showing the additional allotments required (both voted
and charged) or surrenders to be made, during the current financial year under each
head, as prescribed in the budget orders, and requiring the sanction of the President.
The variations between the final modified allotments required and the revised estimates
as fixed by the Board should in all cases be supported by adequate explanations of the
reasons for the demand or surrender.
33

386. The railways should, however, continue to review the budgetary position further
on submission of the Final Modification statements and any modification that may be
considered necessary as a result of new factors visualized and the further review of
budgetary position should be advised to the Board at the earliest.
387. Deleted
388. Deleted
389. The figures of supplementary grants required or surrenders made in respect of
―Interest on other obligations and reduction or avoidance of debt" and ―Loans and
Advances bearing interest" should be submitted to the Railway Board so as to reach
them not later than the 15th February each year. These figures should be final, as no
change in the allotment of these grants can be made later.
390. Supplementary and Excess Grants- Notwithstanding the provisions in
paragraph 382, when the amount of a grant/appropriation in the budget is found to be
insufficient for the purpose of the current year, an estimate for supplementary grant
/appropriation, is submitted by the Railway Board to the Ministry of Finance for the
vote of the Parliament/sanction of the President in the same way as the original
―demand for Grant/Appropriation" except that the recommendation of the President has
to be obtained for supplementary Demand not only under Article 113 (3) but also under
Article 115 (1) (a) and 115(2) of the Constitution.
391. Unlike Budget Grant and Supplementary Grant which are obtained from
Parliament in respect of expenditure to be incurred during the year, Excess Grant relate
to expenditure already incurred, for reasons to be fully explained, in excess of the
money voted by Parliament to meet the expenditure during a year. The Demand for an
excess grant is based on the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee as a
result of their scrutiny of the Appropriation Accounts of the Railways and the Audit
Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (see, Chapter IV). Consequent upon
merger of Railway Budget with Union Budget in 2017-18 the Demand for Excess Grant
in respect to Ministry of Railway is now presented by the Ministry of Finance.

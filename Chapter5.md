CHAPTER-V
Budgetary & Expenditure Control Financial/ Management Reporting
501. As stated in para 304, the Railway Budget is an important instrument of
Parliamentary Financial Control, expenditure control and management tool. The
financial targets as set out in Budget broadly guide the performance targets of the
Railway administration. The manner in which budgetary and expenditure control is
exercised is stated in the following paragraphs.
502. Gross Revenue - It is important that a continuous and concurrent watch is kept
on the realisation of revenue as envisaged in the Budget. This is done through the
medium of a ten-day statement of revenue on "originating" basis and monthly financial
review on „apportioned‟ basis. These statements should give also the proportionate
budgeted revenue on originating and apportioned basis and the actuals for and to end
of the relevant period of the preceding year for comparison. The originating basis is
adopted to secure prompt reporting since the Railway wise apportioned revenue for
each month does not become available until a week later.
Enhancing the Gross Revenue is of utmost importance and it should be ensured that
any shortfall in any segment of traffic revenue is promptly brought to the notice of
concerned departments.
503. A monthly statement of „approximate' gross revenue on the basis of estimated
apportionment between various Zonal Railways is also sent by the Railways to the
Railway Board in the first week of the following month in Form 344-A l. This statement
should be compared with the proportionate budget for and to end of the month to see
the extent of variations, if any, between the budget and actuals, ascertain the causes
thereof and take such step as are necessary.
504. Revenue and Capital Expenditure -As all Railways expenditure, other than
that “charged” on the Consolidated Fund of India, is voted in the form of the Demands
for Grants (para 305), the budgetary control is intended to ensure that expenditure is
incurred for the purposes and within the limits, as voted by Parliament. The authorities
responsible for the control of expenditure against each Major Head of the Grant are
detailed in Annexure I to Chapter III. While it is the duty of the Railway Board, as the
controlling authority in respect of the total amount of each Major Head within the Grant
voted by the Parliament and Appropriation sanctioned by the President, to watch the
progress of expenditure and to keep the aggregate charges within the amount of the
Grant or Appropriation placed at their disposal, it is the responsibility of the individual
3

railway administration to exercise a similar control over the allotments placed at their
disposal. When several officers are authorized to incur expenditure relating to a sub-
major head, against a lump sum allotment placed at the disposal of a single higher
authority, it devolves upon this authority, to watch the progress of expenditure in all the
concerned offices and to keep the aggregate charges within the allotment fixed under
that sub- major head.
505. Power to incur expenditure on Railway matters have been delegated by the
Ministry of Railways (Railway Board) to authorities subordinate to them (vide Annexure
I (Now deleted) and Annexure-II). The exercise of authority for incurrence of
expenditure carries with it also the responsibility for control of expenditure within the
authorized limits. Further, these powers are subject to provisions contained in the
various Codes, rules and regulations and also observance of the standards of financial
propriety (Para116).
506. Revenue Expenditure -The revised and budget estimates of ordinary working
expenses submitted by the General Manager to the Railway Board are based on
detailed-estimates of revenue expenditure obtained by him from the various heads of
departments of the railway. On receipt of the allotment from the Railway Board, these
detailed estimates may require modification consistent with the allotment sanctioned by
the Railway Board or as may be deemed necessary by the General Manager.
507. (Ref Para 506). Within the amounts of the allotments fixed by General Manager
under paragraphs 365 and 506 for the various spending authorities in charge of
divisions and departments, such authorities have full power to sanction expenditure on
revenue account during the year, subject to the condition that the specific sanction of
the competent authority must be obtained separately to all items of expenditure on
establishment and experimental or special temporary works where under rules or orders
such sanction is necessary; in a case in which the General Manager has prescribed that
detailed estimates should be prepared and administrative approval and technical
sanction obtained before the incurrence of expenditure, the procedure laid down by the
General Manager must be followed. The sanction as prescribed should be accorded only
after ascertaining the quantum of allotment. A liability register should be maintained by
executive as well as accounts office for the same including, inter alia, incurred as well
as accrued liabilities.
Any sanction should not be based merely on past trends. The principles of Zero Based
Budgeting i.e. necessity and utility of any expenditure being sanctioned must be
thoroughly applied prior to according sanction.
4

507 A. (Ref Para 506). A sanction for any fresh charge shall, unless it is specifically
renewed, lapse if no payment in whole or in part has been made during a period of
twelve months from the date of issue of such sanction. Provided that –
i) when the period of currency of the sanction is prescribed in the departmental
regulations or is specified in the sanction itself, it shall lapse on the expiry of
such periods; or
ii) when there is a specific provision in a sanction that the expenditure would be
met from the Budget provision of a specified financial year, it shall lapse at the
close of that financial year; or
iii) in the case of purchase of stores, a sanction shall not lapse, if tenders have
been accepted (in the case of local or direct purchase of stores) or the indent
has been placed (in the case of Central Purchases) on the Central Purchase
Organization within the period of one year of the date of issue of that sanction,
even if the actual payment in whole or in part has not been made during the said
period.
Notwithstanding anything contained above, a sanction in respect of an addition to a
permanent establishment, made from year to year under a general scheme by a
competent authority, or in respect of an allowance sanctioned for a post or for a class
of Government servants, but not drawn by the officer(s) concerned, shall not lapse.
508. Proportionate Budget allotment -For the purpose of carrying out a
meaningful comparison of the actual working expenses for (and to end of) the month
with the budget allotment, it is necessary to distribute the sanctioned allotment for the
year over the twelve months after taking all known factors of disturbance or special
features into account. While the responsibility for the control of expenditure against the
budget allotment devolves upon the authority at whose disposal the allotment has been
placed, it is the duty of the Accounts Officer, in his capacity as the financial adviser to
the Administration, to render all possible assistance to the controlling authorities in the
exercise of such control. Accordingly, he/she works out, at the beginning of each
financial year, in consultation with the officers responsible for the control of
expenditure, the estimated progressive expenditure (Proportionate Budget Allotment –
BP) under each Major Head and sub major head keeping in view the following factors:
i.Throw forward from the previous year.
ii. All expenditure whether in cash or by transfer, the liability for which already
exists, but which is not likely to be distributed evenly during the year, whether
5

because it is of a periodical nature, or because it is contingent on the receipt of
supplies, or for any other reason.
iii. Expenditure which is practically fixed and evenly distributed throughout the
year.
iv. Other expenditure which is likely to be incurred during the year but liabilities for
which have yet to be incurred.
v. The need to keep some amount as a reserve for meeting fresh or unanticipated
expenditure.
The BP so fixed may be fed in accounting software (IPAS) for monitoring of
progress of expenditure.
509. In respect of sub-heads for which such detailed analysis is not practicable or
necessary, may be ,interalia ,because the expenditure does not fluctuate from month to
month, e.g. establishment charges, past actual as worked out for a number of years
may form the basis for this estimate.
510. From the details thus worked out, the "Proportionate Budget Allotment- BP" for
each month is worked out for each sub-major head of the Major Head, and the
progress of expenditure under each sub-major head is then watched from month to
month through Monthly Financial Reviews (see paras 511&513) in order to see that the
expenditure is according to anticipations and not at a pace which is likely to lead to an
excess at the end of the year.
511. Monthly Statement of Approximate Receipts and Expenditure -A
statement of approximate receipts and expenditure under such heads as may be
prescribed should be sent to the Railway Board. The merit of this statement lies in
supply of information promptly to the Railway Board for the purpose of watching the
expenditure against the proportionate budget allotment. The monthly statements will,
on receipt from the various railways, be consolidated in the Railway Board's office in
one single statement for all the railways. A copy of the consolidated statement should
also be furnished to the Ministry of Finance of the Government of India and the
Accountant General, Central Revenues, in the first week of the second month following
that to which it pertains.
512. Revenue Allocation Registers -As described in para 311 of Accounts Code
part I, all revenue expenditure is to be recorded in Registers, which are known as
Revenue Allocation Registers, by the various heads of accounts prescribed in the
classification given in Appendix I (Volume II). The object of these registers is to keep
the heads of divisions, and departments informed of the progress of expenditure
6

against the allotments placed at their disposal by the General Manager, which should be
entered in red ink in the appropriate columns provided for in these registers, so as to
form a ready means of comparison and check with the outlay.
However, under computerized system, the RAR may be drawn through system and
used for complying with the above objective.
513. Monthly Financial Reviews -The monthly reviews show the expenditure to the
end of the previous month, against the allotment placed at the disposal of the
controlling authorities under each sub-major head of the Major Head for which they are
responsible. The review should be prepared in Form No.513 and submitted to the
controlling authorities every month, by such date as maybe fixed in consultation with
them. It may be ensured that no liability is committed to in excess of the respective
allotments as derived from the Monthly Financial Review.

514. The "Proportionate Budget Allotment" to the end of the month (column 3) is
worked out by the Accounts Officer in accordance with the Instructions contained in
paragraph-508 above. The figures of actual expenditure for and to end of the month
(column4), and for the corresponding period of the last year (col.5) will be available
from the Allocation Registers and the compiled accounts. The Accounts Officer should
complete the other columns of the review provided above and submit it to the
controlling authority, along with the comments of the executive officers responsible for
the expenditure and with such remarks of his own as may be necessary
515. In compiling this review, the Accounts Officer should see whether-
a) The non-fluctuating expenditure is in accordance with the monthly
appropriation as worked out on the basis of actuals in past years,
b) The periodical expenditure is in accordance with the proportion at budget
allotment,
7

c) The correlation assumed between receipts and expenditure, in the preparation
of the budget is maintained. For the purposes of this comparison, items
pertaining to the period, but remaining unadjusted for any reason, should not
be lost sight of.
Care must be taken to ensure that any major deviation in anticipated expenditure,
which may either result in extra spending or savings, are accounted for even in case of
non-fluctuating expenditure. Savings can be affected due to cancellation of large
number of trains for prolonged period, spending can increase due to implementation of
Pay commission, commissioning of a new block section etc.
516. The Monthly Financial Reviews should be prepared by the Divisional/Workshop/
Construction Accounts officers concerned for each Division/Workshop/Construction Unit
and the Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer should arrange for the
consolidation of these reviews into the Monthly Financial Review for the railway, the
details of procedure and the due dates being prescribed in consultation with the railway
administration.
517. Re-appropriations -No liability, for which a provision does not exist or the
provision for which is inadequate in the allotment sanctioned by the General Manager,
should be incurred unless the necessary funds can be obtained either by re-
appropriation or fresh allotment.
Such liabilities may, however, be liquidated provisionally, if otherwise in order, on the
spending authority‟s undertaking to find the requisite funds. All such expenditures
should, however, be held by the Account Officer under objection "for want of
appropriation " or as "excess over appropriation."
518. The Accounts Officer should advise the spending authorities about re-
appropriations wherever needed, and how they are to be made. He should ensure that
re-appropriations are carried out promptly and that whenever a saving under some
head is reasonably certain, steps are taken at once to withdraw funds from the sub-
head, and whenever it is clear that the progress of expenditure under some head is
such as to require an additional appropriation, steps are taken to arrange for it by re-
appropriation or otherwise.
Expenditure On Acquisition, Construction And Replacement Of Railway
Assets
519. Separate allotments are placed at the disposal of railway administrations under
8

each Grant for expenditure on works chargeable to Capital, Depreciation Reserve Fund,
Development Fund, Railway Safety Fund, Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh and Capital
Fund. These allotments are made in lump sum and their distribution over the various
sub-heads and over the works for which they are intended are spelt out in the 'Works,
Machinery and Rolling Stock Programmes' which are furnished to the railways along
with the Budget orders sanctioning the allotments. These “Programmes” also show, in
the case of work costing Rs 2.5 crore and above each, the total estimated cost of each
work, and the Railway administrations are required to exercise a control over
expenditure, not only against the allotment sanctioned for the year for each work, but
also against its total estimated cost as shown in the 'programmes'. In regard to works
costing not more than Rs.2.5 crore each, a lumpsum is allotted to each railway
administration in the programmes; before any expenditure is incurred against the lump
sum allotment, the estimates of such works should be sanctioned by the General
Manager or any lower authority empowered by him in this behalf. Thus the control of
expenditure on railway is exercised through-
1) the-preparation, in advance, of estimates of the expenditure to be incurred;
2) the allotment of funds through budget Grants for the year, on the basis of
these estimates; and
3) the continuous and concurrent review of the expenditure as incurred against
the details of the estimates and against the sanctioned grants, so that
revisions of estimates or re-appropriation of funds are arranged for at the
earliest possible point of time.
The procedure to be followed in controlling expenditure against estimates is detailed in
Chapter XIV and XII of the Indian Railway Code for the Engineering and Mechanical
Departments, respectively.
520. Watch over Progress of Expenditure -From the moment expenditure or
liability is incurred on works, a check at regular and frequent intervals should be made
on its progress, both against estimates and against funds. The check should originate
in the lowest executive unit,viz., a division.
521. The Works Registers (Form No. E. 1474) maintained in each division enable a
running comparison to be made between-
a) The expenditure incurred on each work and the detailed provision made in the
estimate for the work, and
9

b) the budget allotment for the work and the actual expenditure to the end of
the month.
The executive officer should examine the works registers monthly or at more frequent
intervals, and watch the progress of expenditure on each work, so that any tendency
towards excess over sanctioned estimates may be investigated and curbed, or fresh
administrative and technical sanction is obtained in time to cover the anticipated
excess.
522. The Accounts Officer should also watch the progress of expenditure on works on
the lines laid down in paragraphs 523 to 533 and advise the executive officers as to the
need of re-appropriations, whenever such necessity arises (vide paragraph 518).
523. In watching the progress of expenditure on works, the Accounts Officer should
see whether-
a) the expenditure upto any date is not in excess of the estimate for the
quantum of work done;
b) the anticipated credits have actually been realized;
c ) all adjustments are made in time and
d) expenditure on any new work is not met by merely postponing or
retarding the progress of sanctioned work.
524. Review of Expenditure -The Accounts Officer should prepare every month two
reviews, one by Sub-heads /PlanHeads of the Grant and the other by individual works,
and present them to the authorities concerned by such dates as may be fixed in
consultation with them.
525. The review of expenditure chargeable to Capital, Depreciation Reserve Fund and
Development Fund by Sub-heads /Plan Heads of the Grant, should be prepared monthly
by the Accounts Officer in Form No. F. 525.

528. The review of the expenditure on the new lines (construction) should show the
information in regard to each construction shown in the "Works, Machinery and Rolling
Stock Programme" for the current year or for which, though not so shown, there is a
„throwforward'.
529. In the case of works, other than track renewals and rolling stock, the review
should be made in respect of-
i) each individual work estimated to cost over rupees 2.5 crore and above
shown in the Works, Machinery and Rolling Stock Programme for the
current year, or for which though not so shown, there is a 'throwforward'.
ii) All works costing not more than rupees 2.5 crore each whether in progress
or new, not as individual works but as one item for the total of such
works, including the „throw forwards'. If the General Manager so directs,
the review should show in detail each item of work for which an estimate
has been sanctioned.
530. In regard to track renewals, the review should show each item of work for which
a separate estimate has been sanctioned by the competent authority.
13

531. As regards Rolling Stock, each individual item shown in the Works, Machinery
and Rolling Stock Programme for the current year or which, though not so shown, there
is a throwforward from the previous year, should be included in the review under the
following detailed heads.-
i) Locomotives.
ii) Boilers.
iii) Carriages.
iv) Wagons.
v) Ferries.
532. With a view to complete the review, the information in regard to (a) the
expenditure for the month, (b) commitments which have neither been paid for nor
included in the accounts for the month and (c) the amount of probable further outlay to
complete the work(columns 6 (ii), 7 and 9 of Form No. F 526) should be obtained by
the Accounts Officer from the controlling authorities concerned.
533. The figures of 'actuals' required for the review will be furnished to the concerned
authorities by the Accounts Officer immediately after such figures are available. The
reviews should be completed by them in accordance with the instructions contained in
paragraphs 525 to 531 and submitted to the Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts
Officer, so as to reach him by the date stipulated by Board.
534. Control of Expenditure against the Capital Suspense Grant -The details of
allotment placed at the disposal of Railway Administrations under the sub-beads/ Plan
heads "Stores Suspense" and "Manufacture Suspense" under capital section are shown

anticipated credits under these suspense heads are shown on the credit side of the said
statements.
535. The detailed manner, in which the control over expenditure, against the funds
allotted for purchases of stores under "Stores Suspense" should be carried out, is
prescribed in paragraphs 505 to 507 and 2862 of the Indian Railway Code for the
Stores Department.
536. Monthly Reviews of Suspense Grant -The progress of debits against the
allotments sanctioned by the Railway Board under 'Stores Suspense' and 'Manufacture
14

furnish the comments on the progress of actual debits as compared with the sanctioned
allotment and credits as anticipated.
538. The attention of the General Manager should be drawn to the progress of debits
and credits, if it shows any necessity for the curtailment of the programme of
purchases. Debits and credits may be sub-divided by the more important items of
stores, if the railway administration so require, in order to regulate purchases.
539. Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer‟s Review of monthly Receipts and
Expenditure – Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer should submit summary of
periodical budgetary MIS of receipts, revenue and capital expenditure to General
manager to enable him to review progress as per milestones.
Exchequer Control
540. All executive officers of the Railway Administrations, who are empowered to
authorize revenue/capital expenditure, must ensure that no expenditure is incurred in
15

excess of the sanctioned allotments. Any such excess has to be viewed as a 'lapse' for
which the officer concerned is liable to be held personally responsible.
Railway expenditure falls into two categories viz., cash and adjustments. The former
covers all transactions completed through cash-payments or issue of cheques and
broadly comprises disbursements to staff and outsiders as also settlement of bills/claims
for supplies and services. Adjustments represent inter or intra accounting unit book
keeping transactions which entail no cash outgo. Exchequer Control is a mechanism for
concurrent regulation of cash outgo by each Disbursing Officer against the cash content
of the budget allotment. The object of Exchequer Control is to establish a system for
correct estimation of cash outgo and to monitor disbursements. It is thus an important
tool of budgetary control.
It is, therefore, important that there should be a total commitment at all levels of
Railway Management to the Exchequer Control procedure.
541. Importance and limitations of Exchequer Control--Para.539 requires the
compilation of a 'Financial Review' wherein the revenue receipts and expenses of each
Railway Administration for and up to the end of every month are compared to the
proportionate sanctioned budget and variances explained. However, as the figures of
actual receipts and expenses for a month are available only in the first or second week
of the second following month, there is a time lag of 6 to 8 weeks between incurrence
of expenditure or realization of revenue receipts and their review with the proportionate
budget. The reason for the time lag is that while cash disbursements and receipts are
accounted for immediately, book adjustments between one accounting unit/Railway
Administration and another take a great deal more time; the books of account for a
month are, therefore, kept open for a longer period to accommodate such 'book
adjustments'. As 'cash' forms, most of the total expenditure of a Railway, Exchequer
Control has the merit of providing an effective means of monitoring a substantial part of
the expenditure on a day-to-day basis.
542. Since the budgetary allocations are sanctioned only for expenditure, Exchequer
Control mechanism is necessarily limited in scope to the control of cash outgo. Railway
revenue receipts are thus excluded from the purview of Exchequer Control but are
subject to usual examination through the monthly financial reviews as well as the
recurring scrutiny of cash remittances from stations and of Bank advices.
16

543. Exchequer Control implies a self-imposed expenditure discipline by means of a
system of day-to-day monitoring to ensure that the cash component of the budgetary
allocations is not exceeded.
For this, the IPAS module may indicate the cash component of each month‟s
revenue/capital expenditure by way of BP (Budget proportion) as also in the trends of
expenditure (for and to end of a period).
544. Railway budgeting is on 'gross' basis. i. e., Parliamentary approval is obtained for
gross expenditure, ignoring the credits/recoveries which are outside the scope of the
Demands for Grants. The actual cash against each budget Demand is also „gross', since
credits/recoveries are usually effected through 'book adjustments' or receipts of cash.
Further, the sanctioned budget grants involve a certain amount of overlap, e.g. ,funds
for purchase of stores are sanctioned under Capital Section of Demand, but when the
purchased stores are utilized for (say) maintenance and operation, budget allocations
are also provided under Revenue section. Cash outgo is, however, involved only at the
first point of activity, i. e., when stores are purchased and paid for and the 'overlap' is
represented in railway accounts through 'book adjustments'.
545. Implementation of Exchequer Control-
Implementation of Exchequer Control involves the following steps.-
i) Correct assessment of the 'Cash' and 'adjustment' portions of the sanctioned
annual budget under each segment of the Demand by each Disbursing Officer,
and also the cash disbursement in respect of 'non-budget' items e. g. refund of
fares and freight.
ii) As accurate an assessment as possible of the monthly requirement of cash,
iii) Issue of monthly cash authorization to Disbursing Officers, and
iv) Concurrent control of cash outgo by each Disbursing Officer.
For the above, the Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officers, while submitting their
Budget Estimates of revenue / capital expenditure and expenditure for Non-budget
items to Railway Board, need to submit monthly/quarterly expenditure plan (MEP/QEP)
with Cash/Adjustment bifurcation.
546. Assessment of Cash Outgo-General Guidelines-
Broad guidelines for making a realistic estimate of the 'cash 'and' adjustment' portions
of expenditure falling within the sanctioned budget as well as in respect of' non-budget
items' are given in Annexure III. 'Adjustments' may involve transactions between two or
17

more accounting units within the same Railway Administration or between one Railway
Administration and another or between a railway and a non-Railway Administration. For
example, as stated in para 544, issue of maintenance stores from stock will involve
book adjustment by transfer from 'Stores Suspense' under Major Head 5002/5003 to
the final head under sub-major heads 04-07 of Major Head 3002/3003. Likewise, in the
case of contracts where one Railway Administration is nominated as the paying
authority for supplies to be despatched to consignees on other railways, the
disbursements by the former will involve cash outgo, but would appear as 'adjustments'
in the books of the consignee Railways. The assessment of cash and adjustment
portions of the expenditure must, therefore, be made very carefully by each Railway
Administration strictly in accordance with the guidelines given in Annexure III. As a
further check on the reasonableness of the bifurcation between cash and adjustment,
comparison with the corresponding figures of the previous year (s) would also be
useful.
547. Staff -The total revenue expenditure of the Railways is accounted for mainly
under the heads 'Staff', 'Fuel & Stores' and 'Miscellaneous'. The commitments in respect
of staff payments are easily ascertainable, and the cash outgo will represent the net
amount payable to the staff, recoveries made through pay rolls/settlement bills being
shown as 'adjustments' except in so far as some of them have also to be paid out in
cash, e. g., Court decrees, payments to Co-operative Societies etc., (cash &
adjustments taken together should add upto the gross debit to the final heads).As staff
expenditure does not usually fluctuate to the extent adjustment expenditure does, the
outgo on account of cash payments is capable of fairly precise estimation on the basis
of the past actual and other relevant factors.
548. Fuel -As regards 'fuel' Exchequer Control is applied at the stage of 'purchases' of
coal and diesel oil under 'Stores Suspense'. Under the final heads, however, the
payment of tax element as well as the cost of electric current for traction purposes and
handling charges will involve cash disbursements. Provision for the cash outgo in
respect of 'fuel' will, therefore, be made at the point where cash payment is involved,
having due regard to the performance link-up for fuel under sub major head 08.
549. Works and Stores -Works and Stores expenditure involve a substantial amount
of cash outgo for payment to contractors/suppliers and departmental establishment.
Likely payments to contractors/suppliers should be forecast by the departmental officers
on the basis of the budget allotment, progress of works and purchase orders, and the
contract terms regarding on account/ final payments.
18

550. For other disbursements covering Compensation Claims, Municipal Services and
Port Charges etc., quarterly/monthly estimates, should be based on the claims likely to
be discharged during the period.
551. Civil Grants -Payments against Civil Grants such as 'Loans & Advances' and
'Debt/Deposit' heads mainly involve cash outgo. There is an annual budget for the Civil
Grants and this should be the guiding factor so far as the cash outgo for the year is
concerned. Subject to this limitation the best possible way of estimating the likely cash
outgo for the year would be the past actuals subject to any specific orders of
Government regarding advances etc. For short-term forecasts, the claims pending for
payment during the quarter/month should be evaluated and provided for.
552. Railway Board Contracts -The effectiveness of Exchequer Control as an aid to
budgetary control depends on the extent of its coverage of Railway Transactions. In
this connection two important areas of control over cash disbursements in respect of
contracts placed by the Railway Board are-
i) Bulk Order contracts, and
ii) Contracts for purchase of free-supply items, steel, track material signalling and
general electrical equipment for Open Line Railways and Electrification Projects,
etc.
The principle in both the cases is the same, viz., one or more Railway Administrations
is/are nominated for making payment to the suppliers, and the debits are then
transferred to the Railways concerned in respect of the materials consigned to them. So
far as the paying Railways are concerned, authorizations for cash disbursements will be
given to them in addition to their own sanctioned budget whereas, for the consignee
Railways, there will be no cash authorization, the transaction being only a 'book
adjustment'.
553. In the Railway Board, the Directorates placing the orders will furnish to the
Budget Branch (Exchequer Control) a statement in the following proforma. This
statement should be sent at the beginning of the year, and supplemented, as
necessary, during the course of the year.

In the case of the Railway Board Bulk Order contracts, the estimated amount of
payment during the year should be reconciled with the provision in the sanctioned
budget to ensure that payments made by the disbursing units are in line with the
budgetary allocations.
554. Assessment of monthly cash outgo- As indicted in Para 545, the PFAs, while
submitting their Budget Estimates of revenue / capital expenditure and expenditure for
Non-budget items to Railway Board, need to submit Major Head-wise monthly/quarterly
expenditure plan (MEP/QEP) with Cash/Adjustment bifurcation.
This statement will form the basis for the Board to issue monthly authorization of cash
expenditure to each Railway Administration and by the latter to the various disbursing
units within the Railway keeping in view the sanctioned budget and extant instructions
of Ministry of Finance.
555. Control of cash disbursements-Spending Units like Zonal Railways/Production
Units and other Units would project their cash expenditure requirement on a monthly
basis by the last working day of a month for the following month under revenue heads
(Staff/Pension, Other than Staff), Capital heads (GBS, Railway Funds, EBR) and Non
budget items in the manner prescribed by Railway Board (Budget Directorate) from
time to time. Based on the sanctioned budget, the Railway Board (Budget Directorate)
would issue authorisations for such cash expenditure. The Units may seek authorisation
of additional cash expenditure for a month by 20th of the month, if any. Cash utilisation
should be reported to Board by 5th of the following month in the manner prescribed by
Board.
IPAS (accounting and transaction software) shall disallow any expenditure beyond the
authorisation given to the spending unit. PFAs would however have the discretion to
20

allow additional expenditure beyond authorisation in case of exigencies while keeping
the Board informed.

557. Various documents and returns prescribed have to be submitted to Railway
Board as per the extant schedule issued by Board.
558. Deleted
559. Watch over Expenditure and Revenue of the last quarter of the year-
Special watch over the progress of expenditure and revenue receipts should be kept by
the Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer in the last quarter of the financial year,
and the attention of the controlling authorities should be drawn to the necessity of the
re-appropriations, withdrawals or additional allotments, as the case may be, and the
manner in which such re-appropriations should be made. Orders of the General
Manager should also be obtained as to whether savings in the current year's grant,
represented by the carry-forward to the subsequent year should be permitted to be
utilized for meeting any other expenditure recurring or non-recurring, during the year.
If any such savings, or any other savings of a non-recurring character, are sought to be
utilized by any authority to meet fresh recurring expenditure, it should be brought to
the notice of the General Manager and ,in important cases, to the notice of the Member
Finance, Railway Board, as well, through the proper channel.
560. Annual Review of Expenditure- The total expenditure for the year, as actually
booked in the accounts of each railway, against the various Grants and Appropriations,
is reviewed through the „Appropriation Accounts‟ described in Chapter IV Of this Code.
Annual Reports Of Railways
561. Object and Scope -Each Railway Administration should submit to the Railway
Board an Annual Report reviewing the year's working under all departments and
referring to any matters either materially affecting the results of working or of general
interest. These reports are intended for the use of the Railway Board and the
administration of the railway concerned.
562. Reports prepared by the Railways will consist of four parts, viz-
I. Report Proper (the narrative portion).
II. Financial statements (Capital and Revenue Accounts).
21

III. Analysis of Working (Statistical Statements.)
IV. Appendices (Statistical Statements.)
563. Responsibility for preparation-The administrative head of the Railway is
responsible for the preparation and submission of the Report, the Accounts Officer
compiling the Financial Statements and furnishing such other information and figures as
may be required for the purpose of the Report.
564. Section I-Report Proper -This section which is signed by the Head of the
Railway Administration should be devoted to a review of the working of the railway
during the year. It should contain for instance, the reasons for variations in gross
receipts and departmental expenditure (generally as compared with the previous year);
brief descriptions of exceptional events, such as damages by floods, etc., and the
measures taken to cope therewith; important fluctuations in the operating results
together with the contributory causes; major works undertaken or completed during the
year; and steps taken to improve or add to the facilities provided for the comfort of the
travelling public, particularly lower class passengers, etc.
565. Section II-Financial Statements -This comprises a set of statements of
accounts of the capital and revenue transactions of the railway. These should be
prepared in accordance with the instructions laid down in Chapter VII of the Indian
Railway Code for the Accounts Department, Part I.
566. Section III- Analysis of Working -This section should include statistical
statements dealing with the different aspects of railway working, which are chiefly used
for the compilation of the statistics published in Indian Railways-Annual Statistical
Statements by the Railway Board. This section should also contain detailed Statements
of Rolling Stock, Statements of Revenue (Earnings and Expenditure) and of Operating
Statistics.
567. Section IV-Appendices -Statements relating to number and cost of staff,
accidents, etc., should be included in this section.

ANNEXURE III
(Ref. para. 546)
Assessment Of Cash Requirement
(A) Items included in the Railway Budget
Grant No. 3 T h is is 'Staff Grant : and the expenditure is incurred wholly in cash
less some of the Pay-roll recoveries such as credit to Provident
Fund, rent and income tax, recovery of loans and advances, etc.,
which are effected through book adjustment. Recoveries for
ultimate Payment to outside bodies such as Co- operative
Societies, under small savings schemes, Postal insurance, etc., will
however, involve cash outgo. Debits for 'order police' would
represent adjustment expenditure.
Materials drawn from stores will be booked by
Grant No. 4
to 9 and 12 adjustment whereas payments to officers, class III and IV Staff,
including workshop staff, will involve cash outgo. Payments to
contractors for handling collection and delivery of goods, and
expenses at out agencies, or work done and for materials supplied
and debited directly to the Grant, without operating upon any
other Grant, will form cash expenditure. A careful assessment by
each Department/Abstract should be made for estimating the
'cash' and adjustment' portion realistically. Similarly payment of
compensation claims will involve cash outgo. Likewise, contribution
and grants, compensation payments and other expenses will
involve cash outgo. Under 'Suspense', debit to Miscellaneous
Advances will mainly represent cash expenditure except for
unallocated stores debits. However under 'Demands Payable',
which is budgetted (within the demand) for 'net' increase or
decrease, increase in credit will represent book adjustment (by
contra debit to final heads), and reduction in credit will result from
clearance under Demands Payable by payment. Consequently, if
there is a net increase of credit under Demands Payable the
budgetted expenditure under the final head should be reduced to
this extent so as to exclude the element of book adjustment by
operation of Demands Payable. On the other hand, a net
reduction under Demands Payable should be added back to the

CHAPTER II
Financial Appraisal Of Railway Projects
201. General Principle -Indian Railways is part of infrastructure Ministry and hence
substantial investments are to be made for augmentation of capacity and expansion of
network which require large investment. Investment decisions are the most important
decisions to be made. It is fundamental to railway system as a commercial undertaking
that expenditure other than that wholly chargeable to Ordinary Revenue incurred on
new assets or for improvement of existing assets should be financially justified and no
expenditure should be incurred without sanction. Moreover these decisions are to be
made by keeping long term perspective in mind and treating IR as a national asset.
202. As an exception to Para 201, while no financial justification as such need be
given in the following cases, it should be seen that the scale of expenditure incurred is
as economical as possible consistent with the extant orders, if any, on the subject:-
a) when the expenditure is incurred on a statutory obligation;
b) when the expenditure is unavoidable on considerations of safety;
c) when the expenditure is incurred on passenger amenity* works; and
d) when the expenditure is incurred on labour welfare works except residential
buildings for which special rules are applicable.
*(Authority Board’s letter no. 2023/F(X) II/10/1 dated 01/02/2023 ACS No1)
Note -
1) When expenditure on any of the above items forms part of a scheme and is
not essential independently of the scheme, the total cost of the scheme,
inclusive of the cost of the above works, should be financially justified.
2) In the case of savings in engine days or wagon days or both by avoidance of
or reduction in detentions to stock, etc., the financial justification should be
worked out on the basis of increased locomotive or wagon, etc., utilization and
consequent postponement of the purchase of new engines or wagons, etc., if
such saving can be definitely secured, and not on the basis of the earning
capacity of the stock saved.
3) Savings on a particular railway should not be taken into account if they mean
a loss on another railway. In such cases, the interest of railways as a whole
should be considered.

4) No credit should be given to a proposed scheme for a saving which can be
achieved regardless of whether the proposed scheme is or is not embarked
upon.
5) If flag stations are included in the new scheme, the cost of operating them
should be taken into account as an item of expense in working out the
financial justification of the scheme.
6) Where a number of works required in connection with and/or increasing the
line or transhipment capacity have to be carried out on different stations of a
section as part of a scheme, the financial justification should be worked out
for the section as a whole, as it might be difficult to allocate anticipated
savings to individual stations.
7) Expenditure on works required for meeting statutory obligations or on
consideration of safety should be subjected to proper scrutiny to see if the
proposal is the result of a fresh development not already covered by the
existing rules, or for implementation of a new recommendation of the
Standing Safety Committee (accepted by the competent authority) or any
Commission of Enquiry set up by Government, as the case may be.
203. Scrutiny by Finance & Accounts Officer -The Finance & Accounts Officer in
his position as the Financial Adviser to the Administration, should carefully scrutinize the
justification for proposed expenditure with reference to the principles enunciated in this
Chapter and other orders on the subject. Even in cases where the return on the
investment is not the determining factor, it will be incumbent on him to examine and
offer his advice on the general merits of the proposal in the spirit of a prudent individual
spending his own money.
204. Test of remunerativeness: The net financial gain expected to accrue from a
project be either by way of savings in expenditure or increase in net earnings (i.e. gross
earnings less working expenses),or a combination of both. Except in case residential
buildings, assisted sidings and rolling stock to which special rules are applicable, no
proposal for fresh investment will be considered as financially justified unless it can be
shown that the net gain expected to be realized as a result of the proposed outgo
would after meeting the working expenses or average annual cost of service(see
para217) yield a return of not less than 10 percent under DCF method on the initial
estimated cost.

(Authority:F(X)-II/2011/ROR/1 dated 05.10.2017)
Note-
1) Interest during construction should be added to the cost (excluding that
chargeable to Revenue) of the projects, the construction of which is likely to last
for more than one year.
2) Depreciation should be calculated on the total cost of the scheme and not only on
the portion chargeable to Capital, unless the contrary procedure can be justified
in any particular case. However, depreciation as an element of working expense is
to be ignored for assessing annual cash flows under the DCF Method (see para
228).
3) In the case of construction of bridges, maintenance charges should include,
besides the Maintenance charges on the bridges proper.
4) The element of interest charges, vide item (d) of para-215, should be ignored in
determining the average annual cost of service in the case of a new project,
though it should otherwise be included for the purpose of working out the
comparative cost of two or more alternative schemes.
205. Following is an illustrative list of the various types of investment proposals which
must pass the prescribed test of financial remunerativeness:
a) New Lines: -
1) Project oriented or ‘single purpose’.
2) General purpose.
b) Line Capacity Works-
1) Gauge conversions.
2) Doublings.
3) Major Signalling Schemes i.e. Tokenless Block Working, Automatic Block
Signalling, CTC, Route Relay Interlocking, KAVACH etc.
4) Lengthening of loops and/or provision of additional loops.
5) Crossing stations.
6) Strengthening of electric traction distribution system and/or major
modifications to electric traction installations.
c) Yard Remodelling and Terminal Facilities-

1) Marshalling yards.
2) Goods and passenger terminals.
3) Transhipment points.
d) Telecommunication Works.
e) Electrification and provision of Loco Sheds herefore
f) Introduction of new services- Passenger trains, container services, etc.
g) Workshops-
1) Production Units.
2) Repair Units.
206. It may sometimes be necessary to reject a more economical alternative, because
of considerations on which it is difficult to put a precise money value. If on the
strength of any such factor a proposal is adopted that is less economical than its
alternatives, the reasons determining such a choice should be recorded in the report of
the estimate containing such proposals. In those cases in which the reasons as
recorded are not accepted by the Finance & Accounts Officer, the latter should offer his
remarks in his certificate of verification of the estimate concerned, so that these
remarks may be taken into consideration by the authority sanctioning the proposal.
207. In regard to works proposals which are intended to increase line capacity,
detailed traffic surveys should be conducted by a team consisting of officers of requisite
status and experience from the Commercial/Operating Department and the Finance &
Accounts Department. Where the traffic survey is conducted along with an engineering
survey (Reconnaisance, Preliminary Engineering or Final location), the traffic survey
report should be prepared under the general guidance of the Leader of the Team who
will be an officer of appropriate status from the Civil Engineering Department.
208. Provision of Rolling Stock –Investment proposals for purchase/manufacture of
additional rolling stock are to be justified on the basis of a general increase in the level
of traffic which may or may not require line capacity works being taken up at the same
time for the anticipated level of traffic. Where a line capacity work is justified due to
anticipated increase in traffic, and also in the case of proposals for new line
construction, the initial cost estimate should, for the purpose of Project appraisal,
invariably include the cost of the rolling stock and the financial return on the project
should be measured with reference to the overall initial cost of the project including the
cost of rolling stock.

209. A very substantial part of the capital employed on the Railways is represented by
the investment in rolling stock. The assessment of rolling stock required for moving
additional traffic is directly related to the targets for movement of freight traffic,
commodity-wise as projected by the Planning Directorate of the Railway Board. For
additional passenger coaches, the Planning Directorate makes a forecast of the rate of
growth of passenger traffic over a specified plan period. This detailed exercise should
take into account the existing and projected operating parameters and efficiency indices
such as wagon turn-round, provision for ‘sickness’, requirements for busy season, etc.
In all cases where a distinctly new type of rolling stock is proposed to be acquired or
manufactured, a detailed financial appraisal should be made of the proposed investment
to see that it yields the requisite financial return.
210. Scheme for change of traction –Projects connected with the electrification
are best formulated on a long term basis after considering the relative claims of the
various high density sections of the Railways for better traction. A thorough techno-
economic appraisal should be made in respect of each of the various sections proposed
to be taken up for change of traction. Wherever possible, priorities for taking up the
scheme for change of traction should be determined on the basis of the relative financial
return expected from the various alternative schemes.
211. Revenue estimate –The revenues expected from additional traffic whether on
the existing line or on a new line should be very carefully estimated in the traffic survey
report. The estimate of revenues should be worked out for each commodity and for the
lead from its origin up to the point of termination of the traffic. It should be ensured,
however, that in case line capacity works are required to be undertaken in the
contiguous section or Railway system over which the additional traffic is expected to be
moved, the initial cost estimate for the scheme takes into account the cost of such
additional line capacity works over the entire lead of the traffic.
212. In the case of a ‘project-oriented’ new line, i. e., when a new railway line is
proposed to be built to serve the needs of a specific project or industrial complex,
the estimated revenue from the traffic which will move on the line should be
assessed realistically in consultation with the authorities concerned with that specific
project. It is, however, essential that the Traffic Survey Team also makes its own
independent assessment of the likely traffic which the project is expected to generate,
instead of placing complete reliance on the data furnished by the Project Authorities or,
in the case of a public sector undertaking, the concerned Department of the
Government. The traffic survey officers must deeply probe into the various stages of
scheduling of the project; e. g. what commitments have been entered into by the

Project Authorities and whether the progress in the execution of the project is
adequate to justify any specific claim in respect of the anticipated traffic. While working
out the additional revenue from the traffic expected to move on the new line over its
entire lead, the Railway Administration should make a careful assessment of the line
capacity works required or terminal or any other facilities to be developed on the
contiguous section/Railway system to carry this traffic. As stated in Para- 211, if
additional works are considered necessary, the scope and cost thereof should be
defined and included in the main project estimate. In case it is considered that
adequate line capacity exists in the contiguous section or Railway system so that the
additional traffic on the new line can be carried throughout its lead on the Railway
without any hindrance the Railway Administration should confirm that no additional
works would be required to be undertaken anywhere on the system to carry this traffic.
213. This approach inevitably involves grouping of a number of works with a common
(or complementary) objective, such as for movement of additional traffic by improving
line capacity, or for avoidance of detention to trains through yards. ‘Group
Justification’ in such cases should be worked out for the project as a whole in case the
individual works cannot stand on their own and must necessarily be taken up as part of
a single project. However, where each of the works is self-contained, selection of
priorities after consideration of various alternatives should necessarily be done with a
view to ‘sub-optimization’, i.e. to realise the optimum benefit for the project by
substituting the less remunerative sub-works by those anticipated to improve the return
further.
214. Before proposals are made out for new marshalling yards or major remodeling of
existing marshalling yards or mechanisation of marshalling yards, goods terminals and
transhipment yards, etc., a work study team should go into the actual working and
suggest such improvements in operation as can be achieved even with the existing
facilities. Additional facilities should be justified only after all the possibilities of
improvement in working by optimum utilisation of the existing assets have been fully
explored and evaluated. For line capacity works generally Master Charts should be
prepared of the existing (optimum) capacity, the extent to which it is presently utilised,
and the capacity expected to be available after the provision of the proposed facilities.
The additional traffic beyond the optimum existing capacity of the section should only
be reckoned for financial appraisal.
215. A. Assessment of Working expenses/Average Annual Cost of Service –
The average annual cost of service of an asset is the sum of:

a) The average annual cost of operation;
b) The average annual cost of maintenance and repairs of the assets;
c) The annual depreciation charges (but see para 228);and
d) Annual interest charges on the cost of the asset.
Note.–In computing working expenses in financial evaluation of any capital expenditure
proposal under D.C. F. technique, only items (a) and (b) above should be reckoned.
215 B. Average cost per unit of service -The average cost per unit of service is
obtained by dividing the average annual cost of service by the total number of units of
service rendered by the asset in a year. In comparing two assets on this basis, care
must be taken to see that the number of units of service taken into account in both
cases represent the actual number utilised or consumed. Units of service rendered by
either of the assets in excess of the actual requirements should be ignored in
computing the cost per unit of the asset.
216. For the purpose of assessment of the average annual cost of operation and
maintenance, full use should be made of the traffic costing data relevant to the
investment proposal under consideration. Correct application of the cost data and, in
particular, assessment of the direct/variable and the indirect/fixed or semi-variable
costs is very important in arriving at a realistic estimate of the working expenses in
respect of the proposed scheme.
217. In applying the unit cost data for working out the cost of moving the additional
anticipated traffic, it has to be considered whether it would be reasonable to adopt the
‘incremental cost’ approach or to take ‘fully distributed costs’ into account. Logically, it
would be realistic to work on the basis of ‘incremental costs’ for any small increases in
traffic and over the short run. In the long run, however, even the so-called fixed costs
will vary, and the incremental or marginal costs may fail to cover such semi-variable
expenses. On the other hand, it would be equally unreasonable to apply fully
distributed costs in all cases while working out the financial implications of a line
capacity work. A realistic (though somewhat conservative) approach would, therefore,
be to adopt ‘long term variable costs’ (based on percentages given at the end of
Annexure ‘A’ for each item of cost) which will ensure not only that projects are not
thrown out because of the adoption of the ‘fully distributed costs’ but also that a
project is considered as remunerative so long as it yields the requisite return after
meeting the ‘long term variable costs’.

218. Provision for depreciation- Depreciation provision in respect of an asset will
be equal to the annual payment to a Sinking Fund which, together with the interest
thereon at such rates as may be prescribed by the Railway Board, when compounded
annually, will provide the amount required for the replacement of the asset at the end
of the normal life. The duration of the Sinking Fund payment will be determined by the
‘normal life’ of the asset, and the amount of the annual Sinking Fund payment will be
ascertained by referring to the table reproduced as Annexure ‘B’ to this Chapter, which
shows the annual amount payable at different rates of interest ranging from 2% to 8%
(over periods extending up to 100 years).
219. Normal lives of assets– For the purpose of the annual Sinking Fund payment
referred to in para 218, the normal life of the various classes of railway assets should
be taken as in the table below (However, instructions issued from time to time from
Board’s Office regarding Codal Life may also be referred to):-

220. Technique of financial appraisal of projects- The following methods of
appraisal of capital expenditure proposals are commonly used in industrial and
commercial undertakings:
a) Accounting rate of return,
b) Pay back period, and
c) Discounted Cash Flow.
Of these, methods, (a) & (b) are employed without considering the time value of
money. These are also known as the 'Financial statement' methods since the
calculation involves data taken from and used essentially in the same form as in
financial statements. When time is considered, the method employed for financial
appraisal is the Discounted Cash Flow method, also called the 'Present value method',
since the time value of money is an explicit consideration.
220 A. DPR for Technical and financial appraisal of projects- Detailed Project
Report (DPR) for projects are to be prepared as per Board’s guidelines. Proforma for
submission of Detailed Project Report is given in Annexure – ‘J’.
221. Accounting rate of return method - Under this method, the rate of return is
worked out by arriving at a percentage ratio of the net gain (i. e., revenue less working
expenses) over the initial anticipated investment of the project. Simply illustrated, it is
proposed to construct a masonry building at a cost of Rs.1 lakh to accommodate an

office which is now housed in a building at a rental of Rs.15,000 per annum. It will be
necessary to ascertain (a) the average annual cost of maintenance and repairs of the
proposed building and (b) its scrap value at the end of its normal life. If these are taken
to be (say) Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 10,000 respectively, then the average annual cost of the
proposed new building will be (a) Rs.5,000 plus (b) Rs. 801 being the annual sinking
fund payments (at 3 per cent for 50 years which is equal to 0.0089 multiplied by Rs.1
lakh minus Rs.10,000), or Rs.5,801 in all. This will result in a saving of Rs. 9,199
(Rs.15,000 minus Rs. 5,801) in the annual rental charges that are presently being paid,
or a net return of 9.2 percent on the investment of Rs.1 lakh.
222. A minor variant of the above illustration would be to take the average investment
over the life of the asset at half the initial cost, viz., Rs.50,000 on the assumption that
depreciation is written off in equal instalments over the life of the asset and the amount
invested on the asset will decrease each year as funds are released through the effect
of the depreciation charge. In that case the return on the average investment will work
out to 18.4%.
223. Pay back period method -Since recoupment of the original capital invested in a
project is an important consideration in appraising a capital investment, the method of
working out the pay back period lays emphasis on the calculation of the time it takes to
recoup the expenditure incurred on the project. In the table given below, the pay back
period is 5 years, as the accumulation of the net cash flow, year by year equals the
initial investment at the end of 5 years:
Original Investment-Rs. 1,00,000
Net Cash Flows (i. e., net earnings or reduction in expenditure) : -
Year Annual Cumulative
Rs. Rs.
1 10,000 10,000
2 12,000 22,000
3 20,000 42,000
4 30,000 72,000
5 28,000 1,00,000
Under this method no attempt is made to assess the return on the capital invested. It
only shows the length of time required to recoup the amount invested on the project,
the assumption being that projects with short pay back period are better investment

propositions than those with long pay back periods. Bare recoupment of the amount
invested under the pay back period method would yield no return unless a suitable
rate of interest return on the capital outstanding in each of the years involved is built
into the calculation of the net cash flow.
224. The method of ranking projects, or project grading, on the basis of pay back
period is of limited application as it can be employed only in situations where there is a
strict time limit to the investment before the expiry of the useful life of the project. An
example would be of a proposed investment in a project in a foreign country where the
political stability can be foreseen only for a limited number of years, or in plant and
machinery involving processes or products that are likely to be replaced by
technological changes within a few years or a 'single purpose' new line where the
known reserves of coal, iron ore, etc., are expected to be depleted/exhausted after a
specific number of years. Though presently not in vogue on the Indian Railways, there
is no bar to the application of the Pay Back Period method to evaluation of Railway
Projects in consultation with the Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer in the
special circumstances illustrated in this Para.
225. Discounted Cash Flow -The accounting 'Rate of Return' (R.O.R.) Method
commonly in use on the Railways does not take into account the time value of money.
Also, the return on investment is worked out as at the time of completion of the project
or at a single point of time (6th year or 11th year) and not through the entire useful life
of the project. The R.O.R. method may, therefore, yield an incorrect result depending
on the point of time selected for the purpose of project appraisal. A factor of
fundamental importance to investment decisions and one which the R.O.R. method
does not take into account is the timing of profits and cash flows that result from an
investment and this factor is crucial to the Discounted Cash Flow Method of project
appraisal.
226. Net Present Value (NPV) or Net Present Worth (NPW) -The concept of
the time value of money which is basic to the Discounted Cash Flow Method is
illustrated thus :
Rs.100 receivable today is more than Rs.100 receivable a year hence, as Rs. 100
received today will earn interest or profits and shall accumulate to more than Rs. 100
in a year's time. Alternatively, Rs. 100 received today can be used to reduce borrowing
thereby avoiding interest payments as well as reducing debts by Rs.100. Assuming that
the Railways' cost of finance is its current dividend rate (say 10% per annum), Rs. 110
received a year hence should be worth Rs.100 today and Rs.100 which may be

received in a year's time is worth about Rs. 91 today (actually it is worth Rs.90.91).
Likewise, the present value of Rs.100 receivable 2 years hence is about Rs.82.64, and
so on. In this way the cash flow for the project in any future year can be discounted to
obtain the present value.
227. The NPV/NPW of a project is sum of the present values of the net cash flows for
all the years of the project's economic life. The net cash flow in each year will be the
expected net reduction in expenditure or increase in net earnings. The net cash flows
are discounted to arrive at the NPV of a project by applying a pre- determined discount
rate. For example, consider the following excerpts:
TABLE - A
From Col.2 under ‘Single payment’
Present value of Re. 1
Year 12% 15% 20%
1 0.893 0.870 0.833
2 0.797 0.756 0.694
3 0.712 0.657 0.579
4 0.635 0.572 0.482
5 0.567 0.498 0.402
TABLE-B
From Col. 4 under 'Uniform series'
Present Value of Re.1 received annually

12% 15% 20%
1 0.893 0.870 0.833
2 1.690 1.626 1.528
3 2.402 2.283 2.106
4 3.037 2.855 2.589
5 3.605 3.352 2.991
TABLE -B is derived by adding the data in TABLE -A. At 20% the 0.833 in TABLE-B is
the same as the 0.833 in TABLE-A since the time involved is only one year. The 0.833
and the 0.694 for years 1 and 2 under 20% represent the 1.528 under TABLE-B at 20%
in year 2. The 0.833, 0.694 and 0.579 in TABLE-A are added to form the 2.106 in
TABLE-B. Thus, it can be seen that TABLE-B is essentially a summation of TABLE-A.
With TABLE-B, present value calculations can be made more quickly if the cash inflows

or out flows are constant. Instead of multiplying the same cash flows by the individual
items of TABLE-A, one can multiply the annual cash flow only once by the sum of
the data in TABLE-A which is conveniently arranged in TABLE-B.
228. Annual Cash Flows- It is important that the annual cash flows should be
estimated on a realistic basis. By definition, the cash flow will take into account only the
realisable revenue and cash expenditure or, in the case of expenditure reducing
projects, the net reduction in cash expenditure. Purely accounting adjustments such as
depreciation and other provisions are to be completely ignored. The reason is that cash
flow is the foundation of the NPV and depreciation is an expense item not involving a
flow of cash. It is implicit in the basic arithmetic of the D.C.F. Method of project
appraisal that so long as the cash flows are adequate from year to year and the NPV
computed at the requisite discount rate equals or exceeds the investment, the capital
invested in the Project will remain intact. This is shown by a solved example below :
Basic data-
Initial investment- Rs. 4,00,000
Annual Cash Flow- Rs. 1,00,000
Life of the Project- 10 years
DCF rate of return (say)- 21.4%(See Para 230)
Year Capital in Net Payment Recovery Capital at the
the surplus of interest of Capital end of the Year

2 3,85,652 1,00,000 82,580 17,420 3,68,232
3 3,68,232 1,00,000 78,919 21,081 3,47,151
4 3,47,151 1,00,000 74,335 25,665 3,21,486
5 3,21,486 1,00,000 68,840 31,160 2,90,326
6 2,90,326 1,00,000 62,168 37,832 2,52,494
7 2,52,494 1,00,000 54,067 45,933 2,06,561
8 2,06,561 1,00,000 44,231 55,769 1,50,792
9 1,50,792 1,00,000 32,289 67,711 83,081
10 83,081 1,00,000 17,790 82,210 871
3,99,129

The small margin of difference (Rs.871) is accounted by the error in interpolation of the
rate of return. It will be seen that at the discount rate of 21.41%, the project has
recovered the original cost in full (Col. 5), apart from paying off interest at the same
rate.
229. Rate of return under D. C. F.-Two alternative methods can be used for
assessing the viability of a project under the D. C. F. technique. For example, assuming
an even cash flow of Rs.4,000 per annum over a period of 10 years in respect of a
project where the original investment is estimated to be Rs.18,000, it will be observed
from the following table that the discount factor of 4.5 (18,000 ÷ 4,000) occurs against
the 10th year under the discount rate of 18%:
Present value of the Re. 1 received annually
Year 16% 18% 20%
8 4.344 4.078 3.837
9 4.607 4.303 4.031
10 4.833 4.494 4.192
11 5.029 4.656 4.327
In this case the rate of return under the D.C.F method for an even cash flow of
Rs.4,000 per annum for an investment of Rs.18,000 will be about 18%. Since the
D.C.F. return of 18% is more than the minimum acceptable rate of return
(say 10%) , the project would be considered desirable from the financial point of'
view. Under an alternative method, the minimum acceptable rate of return
(say 10%) would be applied to calculate the NPV of the project. If the NPV is
(zero or) positive, it would be financially acceptable, and if the NPV is negative, the
project will not be financially acceptable. In judging the ranking of competing projects,
under the first method, the D. C. F. rate of return would be used and whichever project
gives the higher rate of return would be preferred. Under the second method, the
competing projects will be ranked according to their NPV and whichever project gives a
higher NPV at the minimum acceptable rate of return would be the preferred project.
230. Another illustration may be given of a case where the initial outgo of (say) Rs.
4,00,000 is incurred in one year and the project starts giving a net cash flow of
Rs.1,00,000 per annum over 10 years thereafter. Discounted cash flow at various rates
of interest would be as shown below where the cash flows are uniform throughout the
project life:

10% 20% 25%
Factor for 10th year 6.145 4.192 3.571
NPV for even cash flow of 6,14, 500 4,19,200 3,57,100
Re. 1 lakh per annum
R.O.R. will be about 21.41%
231. The simple illustrations given above presume that the investment is completed
in one year and the project starts yielding a return immediately thereafter. Where the
investment is spread over a number of years, it is necessary to work out the value of
the investment, by applying the relevant rate of interest, from the inception up to the
point when the project is expected to be ready for operation, the rate of interest
being the minimum acceptable rate of return of (say) 10%. In the illustration given in
the preceding para, if the investment of Rs. 4,00,000 is assumed to have been spread
over a period of three years including the year in which the project was completed, the
total investment, inclusive of interest, up to the year of completion would be as shown
below :-
0% 10%
Year Interest Rs. Interest
Rs.
-2 1,00,000 1,21,000
-1 1,50,000 1,65,000
0 1,50,000 1,50,000
Total investment 4,00,000 4,36,000
In this case, if the net return over the life of the project of ten years assumed in the
earlier illustration is constant amount of Rs.100,000, the return would be about 18%
instead of 21.41 % worked out in Para 230.
232. A short write-up on the technique of working out the rate of return under the
Discounted Cash Flow Method is at Annexure 'D'. Detailed examples of railway projects
showing application of the D. C. F. technique are given in Annexure 'E'.
233. Residual Value -Each project will have an estimated life span at the end of
which the various assets will be disposed of or put to other uses. The flow of funds
created by the sale or disposal of the assets at the end of the life of the project should

be estimated so that appropriate credit can be given to the project in the year in which
the flow of funds is expected to occur by the sale or disposal of the assets. Since all the
assets may not be discarded or sold at the same time, the cash flows resulting from
residual values should be allocated to the years in which they are likely to be received.
If some of the assets are to be taken out of service and disposed of before the
termination of the project, the resultant cash flows must be included in the appropriate
years.
234. Alternative Schemes - Equivalent Annual Cost - The criterion of choice
between alternative schemes, each of which is capable of rendering the required
service, is the principle of least cost in the long run. This approach is particularly
applicable when the cash outflows under each competing project have sharply different
time patterns. To obtain the annual cost, the outlays of the project are summarised into
a single present worth amount and then spread over the years of the project life as an
equal amount per year, which includes interest at a standard rate. By the same
summarization and spreading for an alternate project, the two projects can be
compared by reference to the per year figure for each. The comparison is usually of
cost only, revenues being assumed as the same under either project. An illustration
appears below :

worth by the present worth of a four-year Re.1/ - per year annuity. This is
the sum of the individual present worth factors .91, .83, .75, .68 which
totals Rs 3.17.

The above analysis shows that Project ‘B’ has the lower uniform annual cost, by a small
margin, even though it shows a larger total outlay. The reason for this is that the
project outlays take place later under Project 'B', which reduces its present worth
and lowers its annual cost including interest, relative to Project 'A'.
235. Economic Evaluation. -As a commercial undertaking, it is incumbent on the
Railways to ensure that a proper financial return is earned from every investment
subject to the exceptions given in Para 202. At the same time it has to be borne in
mind that the Railways are an important instrument of economic and industrial
development of backward areas not connected by a reliable transport network. In the
case of major projects such as new line constructions, or change of traction from
diesel to electric, the benefits likely to be realised by the economy as a whole are
assessed by the Economic Adviser to the Railway Board. The principles on which
economic evaluation of Railway investments should be carried out as distinct from
working out a financial return to the Railways, are indicated in the note (together with
an illustration) at Annexure 'F’.
235A. A detailed economic appraisal framework is given in Annexure- ‘I’.
236. Replacements and Renewals -The proposal for replacement of an existing
asset (whether involving improvement or otherwise) should be examined critically with
a view to seeing whether it would not be possible to avoid, or, at least, postpone such
replacement by suitable repairing or reconditioning the asset at a cost that could be
comparatively justified financially. In all cases in which it is considered necessary to
replace an asset, instead of reconditioning it, it should be examined whether the
estimated average annual cost of service (i. e. cost of operation and maintenance,
sinking fund payment to the depreciation fund, and the interest on the cost of the
asset), or the estimated average cost per unit of service of the new asset is likely to be
less than that of the old asset after reconditioning. Except when renewals or
replacements are inevitable, the expenditure chargeable to the Depreciation Reserve
Fund, should be financially justified in the same manner as any other expenditure of
capital nature.
237. Where a replacement is proposed on grounds of economy in operation and
maintenance costs, the estimate therefore should justify the outgo on the proposed
replacement by showing that the average annual cost of service or the average cost
per unit of service, that will be rendered by the new asset, is less than that of the
existing asset.

Note -The above two paragraphs will not apply to cases of casual or programme
renewals, not involving any improvement.
238. Reconditioning – When an as asset is repaired at a comparatively high cost in
preference to its being replaced, it is referred to as being ‘reconditioned’. The cost of
such reconditioning is chargeable to Ordinary Repairs and Maintenance. It may be noted
that reconditioning is different from routine repair. For all reconditioning works, detailed
estimates should be prepared.
239. Scrapping, condemning and abandoning assets - An asset may be
scrapped, condemned or abandoned without replacement, when the service rendered
by it is no longer required. If the service rendered by it is still necessary and if it is
proposed to make other arrangements for such service, it should be definitely
established that it is more economical to scrap, condemn or abandon the existing asset
and obtain the required service from the new arrangement than to continue to obtain
the required service from the existing asset. Here also the relative economics of the two
proposals should be assessed on the basis of the average annual cost of service or the
average cost per unit of service, as the case may be.
Note -The preparation of financial justification as contemplated in this paragraph is not
necessary for condemning rolling stock in the following cases:-
i) Overaged stock due to be replaced by virtue of their age but condemned
before replacement.
ii) Under or overage stock involved in accidents and certified to be irrepairable
(not included under the category of “beyond economical repairs”).
iii) Non I.R.S. type coaches and wagons of inherently weak design proposed to
be condemned on condition basis whether under or overage.
240. Examples are given in Annexure ‘G’ illustrating the method of financial
justification to be adopted in the case of replacement, reconditioning or abandonment of
existing assets. The data used in the illustrations are hypothetical and the methods
adopted are not to be regarded as exhaustive or as precluding the use of other methods
that may be found to be more appropriate. The D.C.F. method can be conveniently
used in some cases as has been shown in Example (1) of Annexure ‘G’.
241. Second-hand Value- The second-hand value of an asset is what it is presently

worth and has often to be distinguished from its scrap value. For purposes of financial
justification of transfer, purchase or sales, the second-hand value of assets may, except
in certain cases (e.g. rails, locomotives, boilers, etc.) where separate rules have been
prescribed for the determination of the second-hand value, be determined as provided
below :-
i) The first cost of an asset (based on which its second-hand value has to be
computed) should be taken as the value of a similar asset at present day
prices and not the value actually paid for the asset when it was originally
purchased.
ii) The second-hand value of an asset that does not depreciate is the same as
the first cost.
iii) The second-hand value of a depreciating asset should be so appraised that
the average annual cost of service or the average cost per unit of service, as
the case may be, of the second-hand asset is equal to that of the same or
similar asset while new.
242. Examples illustrating the application of the principles enunciated in the preceding
paragraph are given in Annexure ‘H’.
243. Post project appraisal - It is important that an investment proposal is
subjected to proper financial appraisal not only before it is a sanctioned but also a
certain period of time after the project has been in operation. Whether the financial
return anticipated from a project at the estimate stage is actually realised in due course
or not should be determined by conducting a ‘Productivity test’ in respect of all major
works. For any such comparison to be meaningful and realistic, it is important that the
computation of the actual additional earnings and working expenses is done on the
same lines as at the project estimate stage. As commercial profitability is liable to be
affected by escalation in prices or any other extraneous development, in order to have
a more reliable and accurate evaluation wherever relevant, a comparison in terms of
physical units of throughput may be carried out. Such a comparison should preferably
be done class-wise in the case of passenger traffic and commodity-wise in the case of
goods traffic. The post project appraisal should be conducted by the user department in
consultation with Engineering and Finance.
Further, all projects sanctioned on the basis of ROR, should be subjected to mid term
review at the time of every revision of estimated cost. Such review shall consist of
review of both existing projection in current scenario, revised estimated cost and
consequential change in ROR. Financial feasibility of project need be assessed and

commented by General Managers of Zonal Railway.
244. New Lines - In respect of each new line opened for traffic, the railway
administration should submit to the Railway Board a statement, showing the financial
results of its working in Form No. 244 shown below. The statement should reach the
Railway Board not later than the 31st December following the financial year to which it
refers and should be accompanied by a covering memorandum in which brief
explanations should be given of important variations between the actual realisation and
the estimated revenue, together with a Note by the General Manager indicating how the
actual net cash flow compares with what was estimated at the project stage. The Note
should also bring out the probable traffic prospects of the line in the sixth and the
eleventh year of opening.

Note- The traffic data required to be maintained vide Para 245 should be used for
costing purposes so as to arrive at the expenditure of the Branch proper and of traffic
moving from the existing line to the Branch line and vice versa.
245. The following statistics should be maintained from year to year in respect of
all new lines opened for traffic and submitted to the Railway Board by l st August of
each year :-
i) a) Passenger revenue from traffic local to the branch line.
b) Other coaching revenue from traffic local to the branch line.
ii) a) Passenger revenue from traffic from the new line to the existing lines and vice
versa.
b) Other coaching revenue from traffic from the new line to the existing lines and
vice versa.
iii) a) Tonnage of goods traffic local to the branch line.
b) Tonnage of goods traffic inter-changed with the existing lines
iv) a) Revenue from goods traffic local to the branch line.
b) Revenue from goods traffic interchanged with the existing lines.
246. The following instructions should be followed in preparing the statement F-244 :-
i) Column 3 should indicate the revenue of the branch from all traffic
originating therein, whether local or foreign (Proportion due to the branch)
and all traffic received from the main line.
ii) Columns 4 & 5 should be worked out on the basis of the costing/financial
data under Group 'C' (see Annexure 'A') in respect of the traffic referred to in
(i) above.
iii) The additional or new traffic interchanged to be shown in column 6 should
include only that portion of the traffic received by the main line from the new
branch and of the traffic from the main line to the branch, which arises solely
from the construction of the new branch line. In the absence of actual figures
of additional traffic interchanged with the existing lines, a reasonably
approximate figure may be adopted. In the case of chord line short-circuiting

a previously existing route, figures relating to cross traffic which would have
been carried by the previously existing route, if the chord line had not been
constructed, may be omitted from this statement and a proportionate
reduction in the working expenses on the branch line made. Column 7 should
be worked out on the basis of costing financial data under group ‘C’ (See
Annexure 'A' and para 217).
247. The statements vide Paras 244 & 245 should be submitted for every completed
financial year after the date of opening of the new line for a period of 11 years. The
actuals for the years to end of which accounts have been closed and the cash flows for
the remaining years of the assumed project life should be arrived at on the basis of the
best possible estimation. The entire series of net cash flows should then be discounted
to arrive at the rate of return compared to the originally expected return. In case the
actual cash flows shown in statement F.244 indicate a fair degree of proximity to the
original estimates, it may be assumed that the cash flows for the remaining years of the
project life will also follow the same trend unless definite foreknowledge is available to
the contrary. If a review of the annual cash flows for a sufficiently long period (say 5 to
7 years) indicates that the cash flows have settled down, within limits, to a 'uniform'
series, the Railway Board may decide that submission of the Statements F. 244 & F.
245 for future years in the case of a particular new line be discontinued.
248. Open Line Works – For the purpose of applying the productivity tests to open
line works, i.e. works undertaken with the definite object of increasing revenue or
reducing expenditure and to which such tests can be applied within five to seven
years of their completion, selection will be made out of these works sanctioned
(and/or charged to Capital) on grounds of remunerativeness. All such works costing
over Rs. 1 crore will invariably be subjected to this test. The result of the test should
be reported by the General Managers to the Railway Board. As stated earlier in the
preceding para in the case of New Lines, the actual net cash inflow for each year, to
end of the 5th/7th year from the date of commissioning should be recorded for each
open line work to be subjected to the productivity test, and the cash flows for the
rest of the project life assessed on the basis of the latest estimate. The whole series of
net cash flow should then be discounted to arrive at the rate of return compared to the
return originally expected.
249. In addition to productivity test to be conducted as provided in paragraph 248
above, a productivity review should also be undertaken in respect of selected works
costing over Rs. 50 lakhs which are estimated to fetch some return, even though not
the return prescribed for a work being classified as remunerative. The methodology to

be followed will be the same as prescribed in the preceding para in respect of works
costing over Rs.1 crore each.
Note-Justification for works or part of a scheme should show the probable period ,that
will elapse between the completion of the works and the time when the productivity
review can be made. This note equally applies to paragraph 248.
250. The fact that productivity tests are to be applied to a particular work should be
intimated to the authorities entrusted with its execution as also to the Finance and
Audit officers. In respect of all such selected works, the Financial Adviser and Chief
Accounts Officer should also keep such statistics as would be necessary for the
verification of the tests conducted by executive, in addition to those usually available.
251. In order to ensure that a work selected either by the Railway Board or by the
General Manager for the application of productivity tests or review is not lost sight of,
Executive Officers and Finance Officers should maintain a register containing a list
showing the following particulars :-
i) Reference to sanction of the estimate.
ii) Brief particulars of work selected for the application of
productivity tests or review.
iii) Total estimated expenditure.
iv) Nature and extent of "productivity" claimed in the estimate.
v) When the test or review is to be applied.
vi) Brief remarks about the results of the test or review.
This list should be reviewed half-yearly and timely action taken to apply the test or
review to all works due for examination during each half-year.
252. When, in due course, the tests or reviews are actually applied or carried out, the
Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer after verifying should submit a report
embodying the results of the test or review to the General Manager. In case of works
sanctioned by the Railway Board, the General Manager will submit the Financial Adviser
and Chief Accounts Officer's report to the Railway Board with his own comments. The
object of these reports is not only to furnish information about results actually achieved
to the authority who sanctioned the expenditure but also to serve as a lesson for the
future.

ANNEXURE -A
(Please refer to Annexure I & J also)
(Ref. paras 216 and 217)
Check List With Detailed Notes For Guidance Of Zonal Railways And Concerned
Branches In Railway Board's Office, In The Preparation Of Project Estimates
The procedures and methodology to be adopted for a proper financial
appraisal of projects are laid down in the Engineering Code and in the Report of the
Committee on Technique of Financial Appraisal of Railway Projects as well as the
circulars issued by the Railway Board from time to time.
2. Some of the survey reports submitted by the Zonal Railways were
scrutinised by the Cost Analysis Cell of the Board's office. It was found that the
estimates of working expenses have been substantially understated owing to many
important elements such as empty haulage, number of marshallings, tare tonne
kilometres, etc., not having been taken into account by the Zonal Railways. In
some cases, instead of applying the unit costs the Railways have adopted the
operating ratio to estimate the working expenses. The operating ratio is only an
end figure and should not, therefore, be used for estimating working expenses.
Further, the revenues depend on the product mix, i. e., the proportion of the high-
rated, low-rated commodities or short lead or long-lead traffic and the estimate
made thereof should be reasonably correct.
3. In order to ensure that no item of cost is excluded and no item of
cost is over stated / understated, a check list, together with detailed notes, has
been prepared for the guidance of the Zonal Railways and the concerned staff of
the Railway Board's office (E.A. Branch F (X) Branch and Planning Branch). The
more common mistakes and deficiencies noted in the calculations at present can be
avoided if the check list is adhered to.
4. Unit costs are worked out for the broad and metre gauge systems of
each of the Zonal Railways under 3 main groups-
Group ‘A’ – Gives the unit costs applicable for all- traction movement. These
unit costs include the direct costs as well as the element of overheads.
Group 'B' - Gives unit costs for particular facets, as cost per shunting engine

hour, train engine hour, engine hour etc., for each traction. The unit costs in this
group include the element of overheads.
Group 'C'- Gives unit costs traction-wise. The wagon provision costs which
include the element of repairs and maintenance, interest and depreciation, are
separately shown. The overheads and the central charges are separately indicated.
Unit costs of line haul are worked out separately for through trains and van
and shunting trains under both groups 'A' and 'C'.
All the unit costs are furnished separately under 3 heads - Working
Expenses, Depreciation and Interest, so that the rate of return can be worked out
both under the conventional method or D.C.F. technique.
Group 'A' and Group 'C' costs are more widely used for assessing the
costs of specific flows or streams of traffic. If the traction is known, the Group 'C'
costs are adopted. If the traction of line haul is not defined or specific, then all-
traction figures in Group 'A' are adopted. Group 'C' costs are much more refined
and specific and, therefore, by taking note of special characteristics of operation
the costs may be estimated with a higher degree of accuracy. Group 'B' costs are
generally used for estimating the savings in monetary terms of engine hours,
wagon hours and shunting engine hours.
5. Study has been made to estimate broadly the variability of different
items of expenditure with appropriate units of performance. The results of the
study are summarised at the end of this Annexure.
6. In estimating the expenditure in respect of additional traffic the
variability factors mentioned above should be adopted to arrive at the long- term
variable costs. In estimating the expenditure in respect of existing traffic, however,
the fully distributed cost should be used.
7. Check list -The check list and procedures/steps for estimating the
costs are detailed below :-

a) No. of Passengers-
(i) Originating
(ii) incoming
b) Train Kilometres
c) Engine Kilometres
d) Vehicle Kilometres.
8. The Traffic Survey Report should give in detail the quantum of
existing freight traffic (originating, terminating, transhipped, cross, etc.) under
important commodity groups, the pattern of movement (origin and destination of
the important flows), the quantum assessed, both in terms of tonnes and in terms
of B.G. or M.G.4-wheeler wagons. The additional traffic should also be assessed in a
similar fashion. In case any difficulty is experienced in converting the tonnes into
wagons, the figures of average starting loads (separately for originating and
transhipped traffic) shown in the monthly wagon loading statements may be
adopted. Otherwise, the minimum weight condition as per goods tariff may be
taken into account.
9. Empty haulage should be carefully calculated taking into account the
outward and inward traffic commodity-wise and equipment-wise. The source of
empties should also be indicated so that the empty haulage may be reasonably
assessed. Otherwise, following norms may be adopted :-

BFRs, Oil tanks, BOBs , BOI and Special types, etc. (B.G. and M.G.) 100%
POL Traffic, iron ore traffic, industrial raw material to steel plants, etc.(B.G. & M.G.) 100%
Coal--Average B. G. 80 %
Other commodities -B.G. 23 %
M. G. (including coal) 33 %
The correct estimate of empty haulage is very essential as this element appears in the
calculation of –
i) Wagon kilometres,
ii) Gross tonne kilometres,
iii) Engine kilometres,
iv) Train kilometres,
v) Wagon days,
vi) Engine days, and
vii) Number of marshalling
yards.
10. Marshalling yards. --The survey report should specify the Inward,
outward and cross traffic dealt with at different marshalling yards on the project
line and the existing main line. This should be separately assessed for the existing
traffic and the additional traffic. We should take into account not only the loaded
journeys but also the empty journeys of wagons. In case traffic bypasses the
marshalling yard, detention to stock for carriage and wagons/train examination for
engine changing and crew changing should be taken into account.
There are at least 2 marshalling yards for any movement irrespective of
distance. The study reveals frequency of marshalling as indicated below:
Broad Gauge Metre Gauge
1-40 Kms. 2.00 2.00
41-120 Kms. 3.00 3.00
121-240 Kms. 3.50 3.50
241-500 Kms. 4.00 4.00
501-800 Kms. 4.50 5.00
801-1300 Kms. 5.00 6.50
1301 and above 5.50 7.50
The above is only for wagons moving in piece-meal. Where the wagons

are moving in a specific stream of Traffic, the actual marshalling requirements
should be assessed on the concerned route.
11. Terminal:- Documentation charges are calculated on the basis of one
invoice per 4-wheeler wagon in the case of wagon load traffic and one invoice for
0.54 tonne of smalls traffic.
In the case of train load movement, one invoice may be adopted for 10 four-wheeler
wagons.
There are cases under which one-end terminal documentation is performed by the
staff employed by the consignee or the consignor. In those cases, this element of
cost for one end may be omitted.
Two terminal costs should be taken, one for the originating end and the other for the
destination end.
12. A special study has been made in the case of coal traffic. The coal
terminal costs at the originating end for 1970-71 are given below :-
Cost Per Wagon
Rail Termina Trip haul between base Other Total
way l Cost yard and collieries costs originating
Terminal
costs
Rs. Rs. Rs. Rs.
Central 15.485 8.046 24.649 48.180
Eastern 17.436 8.307 19.870 45.613
South Central 8.605 4.918 17.210 30.733
South Eastern 19.118 11.101 19.514 49.733
Total Indian Railways (B.G.) 17.202 8.803 19.917 45.922
At the destination end, the average unit costs would apply even in the case of
coal traffic.
13. Wagon days - It is not correct to adopt wagon kilometres per wagon
day for assessing the wagon requirements. To illustrate this point, the example of a
short distance traffic of lead of 40 kilometres with an empty return ratio of 100%
may be considered. The wagon requirement on the basis of wagon kilometres per
wagon day would work out to only one wagon day. It is common knowledge that it
would take at least 3 days for the wagon to be loaded, unloaded and brought back to
the loading point for the subsequent loading, if the detention to stock at the

originating end, terminating end, transit time and contiguous marshalling yards were
properly taken into account. In the case of fairly long-lead traffic, the wagon user
index may be adopted.
14. Engine kilometres - After calculating the train kilometres on the
basis of the permissible load (in terms of BOX or 4-wheelers and the gross load) on
various sections, the engine kilometres should be assessed on the basis of -
i) Single engine operation or multiple engine
operation,
ii) Banking engines over gradient sections; and
iii) Light engines.
Figures of engine kilometres per engine day used for goods traffic are readily
available in the Annual Reports and Statistical Pamphlets for each traction. It should
be possible to work out engine days required on this basis after giving due allowance
for the element of repairs and spares.
For example, 4 million tonnes of iron ore are to be moved over a section 100
kms. in length. The movement will be in BOX wagons with load of 55 tonnes each.
The section is heavily graded and the trains will run triple headed (diesel traction)
with a load of 40 BOX’s plus an additional banking engine over a section of 8
kms. Estimates of engine km/engine days will be as follows :-
1) No. of trains each way 1,818
2) Train kms. both ways with 100% empty return (1818 x 2 x 100) 3,63,600
3) Assisting required and Assisting not required Engine km. 7,27,200
4) Banking engine kms. (1818 x 2 x 8) 29,088
5) Light engine kms. (say 6% of train kms.) 21,816
1,41,704
6) Bare-engine days required @ say 360 km. per engine day in use 3172
(goods).
7) Total engine days required (add 16% for POH, spares, etc.) 3680 or
10 engines
The nature of movement should also be taken into account, i. e., whether the
traffic is carried by shunting and van train or by through trains. The cost
characteristics are different and separate unit costs are available.
15. Fuel and lubrication costs are calculated on the basis of GTKms. Other

operating costs (line haul) are calculated on the basis of train kilometres/engine
kilometres.
16. Track and signalling line haul -This is calculated on the basis of
GTKms. The average unit costs are not adopted for estimating the cost under track
and signalling. A slight refinement is made taking into account the variability of this
item of expenditure with reference to GTKms. The variability studies reveal that 50%
of this expenditure is variable with GTKms. The average unit costs applicable to B.G.
or M. G. systems of an individual Railway are adjusted by taking into account the
specific density of traffic on the route or sections involved and the average density of
the Zonal Railway system. As an illustration, a section with an average density of
18,000 tonnes per day as against the average density of 12,000 tonnes per day on
the gauge may be considered. If the average unit cost for the gauge is Rs. 6.00 per
1000 GTKms., then the average unit cost for the section will be
= Rs.3 + ⌠ Rs.3 x 12000 ⌡ or Rs.5 per 1000G.T.Kms.

The use of the Table – What sum must be paid at the end of each year to Sinking Fund so
that the annual payments together with interest therein at 4 per cent compound annually,
will at the end of 18 years amount to Rs.2,000/-
Opposite 18 under 4 per cent we find 0.0390 which is the annual payment required for
Re.1/- so for Rs. 2,000 the annual payment is 2,000 x 0.0390 i.e. Rs. 78/-

Interest Formulas And Tables For Discounted Cash Flow Techniques
Interest Formulas
The interest formula and tables that follow may be found of considerable use in
evaluating the financial aspects of Engineering projects.
Symbols:- The symbols used in these formulas and Tables are:
i represent rate of interest per interest period.
n represent number of interest periods
p represent sum of money
S - do - sum of money that is equivalent to p with interest i, at the end of n
R - do - the end of period payments/receipt in a uniform series continuing for
the coming n periods, the entire series equivalent to p at interest rate i.
Formulas :- The interest formulas expressing the relationship between P, S and R
in terms of i and n are :- Given P, to find S
S = P (1 + i)n (1)
Given S, to find P . P = S 1 (2)
(1 + i)n
Given S, to find R , R = S 1 (3)
(1 + i) n-l
Given P, to find R , R= P i (1 + i ) n (4)
(1 + i ) n-1
Given R, to find S , S= R (1+i)n-l (5)
i
Given R, to find P , P= R (1+i) n-l (6)
i (1+i) n
In the following explanations of these formulas the interest period is taken as
one year; the explanations can be made general by substituting "Period" for "year".
Development of Formulas for Single Payment- If P is invested at interest rate l,
the interest for the first year is iP and the total amount at the end of the first year is P(l+i).
The second year the interest on this is ip(l+i), and the amount at the end of this year
is P(l+i)+iP(l+i) = P(l+i)2 . Similarly at the end of the third year the amount is P(l+i)3 ; at the

end of n years it is P(l+i)n.
This is the formula for the compound amount, S, obtainable in n years from a principal, P.
S = P (1+i) n (1)
If we express P in terms of S, i and n
P = S 1 (2)
(1 + i) n
P may then be thought of as the principal that will give a required amount S in n
years; in other words, P is the present worth of a payment S, n years hence.
The expression (1+i) n is called the single payment compound amount actor
(denoted as cu’). Its reciprocal 1/(1+i) n is called the single payment present worth actor
(denoted as pwf.)
Formulas for Uniform Annual Series of End-of Year Payments - If R is
invested at the end of each year for n years, the total amount at the end of n years will be
the sum of the compound amounts of the individual investments. The money invested at the
end of the first year will earn interest for (n-1) years; its amount will thus be R (l+i)n-1. The
second years payment will amount to R (l+i)n-2 ; the third years to R(l+i)n-3; and so on until
the last payment, made at the end of n years which has earned no interest. The total sum S
is then given by the expression-
S=R[ (1+(1+i)+(1+i)2 …+(1+i)n-2+(1+i)n-1] (i)
To simplify, multiply both sides of the equation by (l+i),
(1+i)S= R[(1+i)+(1+i)2+(1+i)3 … +(1+i) n-1+(1+i)n] (ii)
Subtracting (i) from (ii)
iS = R[(1+i)n-1]
or S = R (1+i) n-1
i
And R=S i (3)
(1+i) n-1
A fund established to produce a desired amount at the end of a given
period of time by means of a series of payments through out the period is called a

sinking fund. The expression—
1
(1+i) n-1
is called the sinking fund deposit factor ( denoted as sff).
To find the uniform end-of year payment, R which can be secured for n years from a
present investment P, substitute in equation (3) the value given for S in equation (I)
R=S l = P (l+i) n i
(l+i) n-1 (l+i) n-1
or R=P i(l+i)n (4)
(l+i) n-1
The expression—
i(1+i)n
(1+i) n-1
is called the capital recovery factor (denoted as crf).
When multiplied by a present debt (which, from the point of the lender, is a present
investment,) it gives the uniform end-of-year payment necessary to repay the debit (the
lender’s investment) in n years with interest rate i.
Formulas (3) and (4) may be reversed to show S and P in terms of R as follows:
S=R (l+i)n- 1 (5)
i
P=R (1+i) n-1 (6)
i(1+i)n
The expression— (1+i) n-1
i
is called the uniform series compound amount factor (denoted as caf)
The expression (l+i)n-1
i(l+i)n
is called the uniform series present worth factor ( denoted as pwf).

Rate Of Return- Using Discounted Cash Flow Method
To simplify calculations, a project evaluation sheet (Exhibit I) together
with an Interpolation Chart (Exhibit II) has been prepared to obtain rate of return
using the discounted cash flow method.
Procedure- Using project evaluation sheet:
a) In column Trial I enter as disbursements the net estimated investment by
years. Enter estimated annual returns for the years in which they will occur,
and include terminal salvage value (if any) as a return in the year in which it
will be realized.
b) Total the disbursements and the annual returns for trial I and enter the
results in A and B lines respectively.
c) To obtain the interest rate which equates the present value of the
disbursements and annual returns, calculate their present worth in trials
2,3,4 and 5 by multiplying the amounts in trial I by the factors indicated in
trials 2 to 5. Add columns to obtain totals A and B.
d) Calculate the ratio of A to B for each trial by dividing the total present worth
of disbursements, Totals (A), by the total present worth of annual returns,
Totals (B).
Note - Trial 5 should be completed only if trial 4 has a ratio of A to B less
than 1
e) On interpolation chart, plot ratios A/B against the trial rate at which they
were calculated.
f) Join points with a smooth curve and read rate of return on the vertical axis
opposite the intersection of the smooth curve with the vertical line
representing a ratio of A to B of I. This is the interest rate which equates
the present value of investments with the present value of annual returns.
Note- If a smooth curve does not result from joining the four points plotted, an
error has been made in calculations or plotting. A minimum of 4 points is, therefore,
necessary to check accuracy.

Details of operational savings -It is expected that with the provision of ACSR
line wire, the control efficiency will be 90% and above. The efficiency below 90 is
primarily due to copper wire thefts. During February, 1970 for 13 days the efficiency
was 90% and above and average hours per train is 4 hrs-55 mts. as against 5 hrs-45
mts. per train during the balance of 15 days. The difference in the hours on road is

EXAMPLE (3):-
Provision of line capacity of 'X' Railway.
A section (82 Kms) is partially doubled in two patches over two stretches totalling 52
Kms. On the 30 Kms. long single line section, there are 4 block stations and all these
stations have two reception lines at present thereby limiting the capacity of the stations
either to crossing of a train or merely to give precedence at the station, both crossing and
precedence cannot take place at the same time.
2. The traffic is expected to increase from 20 trains each way on the single
line section at present to 24 trains in the course of a year or two. At the end of 5 years, one
more passenger train and two goods trains are expected to be introduced, increasing the
train density to 27 either way. As against the projected line capacity required at 80%
utilization for the above level of traffic at 30 and 34 in the 1st and the 5th the year
respectively, the line capacity at present is restricted to 27. All capacity calculations assume
diesel traction.

3. The following alternative are being considered for increasing the line
capacity to match the progressive traffic requirement :-
Alternative (1) : Doubling of the entire 30 Kms section - Cost Rs.1.90 crores; capacity 44
paths either way.
Alternative (2) : Doubling the section in two phases:
(a) Immediate doubling of 20 Kms section - Cost Rs.1 crore; capacity 32
paths either way.
(b) Doubling of the remaining 10 Kms length at a cost of Rs.90 lakhs in
5th year - capacity 44 paths each way
Alternative (3) : (a) Provision of one additional reception line at each of the 4 block
stations at an approximate cost of Rs. 10 lakhs straightaway; capacity 30
paths each way.
(b) Doubling of the entire 30 Kms section in 5th year-cost Rs.1.90 crores;
capacity 44 paths each way.
The additional Revenue likely to accrue on account of additional traffic worked out,
commodity wise, as apportioned to the section in the 1st and the 5th years on the traffic
projections for these years assuming the level of traffic to remain constant during this period
and 5th year and beyond, are tabulated below :-

Alternative (1)
Full Doubling:
If doubling is done straightaway, the return comes to 8%. In this case the
cash out-flow is Rs.1.90 crores during 2016-17 and 2017-18 while the cash in flow is
at the level of 8,40,000 for 2016-17 to 2018-19, Rs.14,01,800 from 2019-20 to 2020-

Note: It is assumed that simultaneously with the doubling work in
progress, it will be possible to carry the additional traffic in 2016-17 and 2017-

Alternative (2)
Doubling in two Phases:
In case the doubling is taken up in two Phases, the first phase of doubling A-B
taken up immediately, i.. e. in 2016-17, and the second phase viz, doubling of B-C
taken up in 2021-22, the rate of return would be about 9% as worked out below:-

2021-22 to 19,63,000 4.45 +87.35 lakh
2046-47 each year 5.30 lakh
With this scheme an extra goods train cannot be introduced for two years during (2019-20
to 2020-21). This entails an annual loss of Rs.1.26 lakh. (Extra wagons Rs.14175, extra
locos 1,12,704 because of detentions as capacity utilization over 80%). Discounted to
present values, this will reduce the above net figure of Rs.5.30 lakhs by further Rs.1.80
lakh but the rate of return will not be altered significantly.

ANNEXURE -F
ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF RAILWAY INVESTMENTS
A purely financial appraisal of investment proposals does not necessarily lead to
the selection of projects which best serve the needs of the community. The
inadequacy of. financial analysis in this regard derives from the fact that projected
cash inflows and outflows associated with feasible investment alternatives do not
correctly reflect the actual benefits to the community flowing from them or the costs
that they impose on the economy. Financial and economic appraisals, however, need
not always lead to conflicting decisions a financially viable project will also be
acceptable on economic grounds whenever the economic return on investment is
likely to be at least as high as its financial yield. But, there can be instances of
financially sound investment proposals which may not turn out to be worthwhile
propositions because the relevant cash outflows do not include all the associated
costs to the economy. Again, on investment which is not expected to be profitable,
may still yield an adequate, or even a fairly high, economic return if the projected
cash. revenue represent only a part of the benefits or incomes that are likely to be
generated by it.
2. Economic benefits attributable to a particular investment can, for a
number of reasons, exceed the revenues directly accruing to the Railways in the form
of fare and freight receipts. In the first place, most users of a facility may be willing
and able to pay somewhat more than what they are actually charged by the
Railways. Secondly, there may also be instances where what the consumers are
actually able to pay for rail transportation is (because of uneven-income distribution)
less than the benefit they derive from it. This, indeed, is the main justification for a
preferential fare structure for certain passenger and suburban services. Finally, for
economic or social policy reasons freight rates on certain key commodities may be
set at levels which do not fully cover rail transportation costs. The entire benefit
derived by the users of Railways can never be qualified; however, at least that part
of it which consists of the difference between cost of transportation and fares or
freight rates actually charged-can be precisely ascertain. *The provision of a rail
transport facility thus directly adds to the well-being of the community by more than
the receipts that accrue thereby to the Railways.
*Likewise, the difference between the cost to the consumer of rail
transportation and that of other modes of transport replaced (partly or wholly)

by it is a tangible and measurable social gain.
Productivity test may not be required for projects sanctioned on considerations other
than hurdle rate/IRR. Further, all projects sanctioned on the basis of ROR, should be
subjected to mid term review at the time of every revision of estimated cost. Such
review shall consist of review of both existing projection in current scenario, revised
estimated cost and consequential change in ROR. Financial feasibility of project need
be assessed and commented by General Managers of Zonal Railway. As IR will be
shifting from the existing Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) based project
assessment to a more comprehensive method i.e. Modified Economic Internal Rate of
Return (MEIRR) to capture the economic and social network impact of any project
interventions comprehensively, MEIRR at different levels will be compared and
examined before reaching any investment decision.
3. Rail transportation, however, can make a substantial indirect contribution
as well to general well- being by facilitating economic expansion. A new line, in a
backward region not well endowed with alternative modes of transportation,
stimulates the growth of output and employment by widening the market for local
products as well as by creating a market for some hitherto unexploited natural
resource. The quantification of such indirect benefits can at best be approximative.
For one thing, the expected expansion of regional or local economic activity is
difficult to forecast. For another, the quantification of "developmental benefits"
poses the problem of allocating expected additions to output and incomes between
the Railway project and other complementary investments in industry, agriculture or
commerce.
4. Great care should be taken in estimating social benefits for the purpose
of economic appraisal of railway investments. Such benefits should, to the extent
possible, be quantified with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Thorough
investigations at the traffic survey stage would help in identifying the
"developmental effects" and in estimating broadly the magnitude the complementary
investments that may be required. Also, the assumptions and reasons underlying
any judgement about non-quantifiable benefits. should be clearly spelt out.
Fortunately, the assessment of social benefits is necessary only in the case of
proposed investments in new rail lines or operations ; as regards investment for
modernisation and improvement, which constitute the bulk of the Railways' capital
outlay, one need only estimate the social costs entailed by investment alternatives In
order to pick out the least cost solution from the point of view of the economy.

5. The expenditure flows associated with Railway projects can, to varying
extents, diverge from the cost to the economy of acquiring resources needed for
their implementation and operation. The prices at which certain inputs and resources
are made available to the Railways, for instance, may understate or exaggerate
their, real cost to the economy. Similarly ,the rupee equivalent of direct foreign
exchange expenditure may differ from the cost of saying or earning an equivalent
amount of foreign exchange. Moreover, the relative prices of various types of
equipment and materials purchased by the railways will be different from the
comparative costs of producing them for the reason that the rates of indirect taxes
(or subsidies) vary from product to product. Lastly, there are certain types of real
costs which do not at all get recorded in the financial cash flows. Environmental
damage can, for example, be a major unrecorded element of cost.
6. In selecting investments which impose the least cost on the economy,
cash out flows have to be recomputed in such a way as to minimise the distortions
caused by the use of prices actually paid for inputs (including the prices of capital
and foreign exchange) and by the neglect of other costs which do not figure at all in
expenses. Environmental effects of investments are the most difficult to estimate
However in a number of cases the choice of projects may be influenced much more
by the interest and exchange rate, that are utilised than by the correction of
distortions introduced by indirect taxes, subsidies and environmental effects. A
preliminary sensitivity analysis is useful for picking out the more important, of the
factors distorting costs; such factors can then be subjected to a detailed
investigation.
7. For economic evaluation of Railway Projects, the interest or discount
rate is currently set at 10 percent. This implies that the cost of capital comprises a
depreciation or capital recovery factor and interest charged at 10 per cent per
annum; a project is thus just acceptable if the expected earnings from it during its
lifetime make it possible to recover the investment with a return if 10 per cent per
annum, that is, if the DCF rate of return on it is 10 percent.
8. In the cash flows utilised for economic, evaluation of high speed diesel
oil is not valued at the price actually paid by the Railways for it. Instead, all taxes
and duties payable on it are excluded from the price; and, the duty-free price is
adjusted upwards so as to allow for the comparative scarcity of crude oil in the
Indian economy. At present this adjustment factor is exactly half the current rate of
excise duty on high-speed diesel oil.

9. There is no direct readjustment of the official exchange rate for the
purpose of computing the scarcity value of imported. equipment, spares and
materials. However, there is an implicit adjustment in as much as the duty paid on
imports is retained as a cost item in the cash-flows ideally, other indirect taxes like
excise duties, sales taxes, local taxes and other cesses and levies, should be
excluded from the cost of domestically procured inputs. But in many cases it has
been found, particularly in the analysis of investment for modernisation of traction,
that the exclusion of indirect taxes and similar levies does not make any material
difference to the ranking of the proposed alternatives.
10. Electric power is valued not at the price at which it is sold to the
Railways by the State Electricity Boards but at its estimated cost to the economy.
The latter is derived from actual production cost by revaluing its interest component
at the rate of 10 per cent per annum and its foreign exchange component at an
exchange rate 33 per cent-higher than the current official rupee price of foreign
currencies.
FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF-
INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES
An Example
A highly simplified hypothetical example of choice between diesel and electric
traction is presented here for the purpose of illustrating the essential difference
between financial and economic evaluation. This type of choice is basically a
problem of minimising the cost of handling a given volume of traffic over specified
sections.
The two project alternatives, dieselisation and electrification, are defined as
follows-
(i) The project life, which includes the construction
period, extends in both cases up to 44 years.
(ii) The level of traffic remains unchanged over the life time of the project.
(iii) Annual operating expenses exclude depreciation and do not vary from
one year to another.
(iv) Capital costs exclude interest during construction**
(v) Capital outlay on dieselisation is spread over a period of

three years; it comprises the expenditure on acquisition of
rolling stock and construction of sheds.
(vi) Capital outlay on electrification is phased over four years; it
comprises the expenditure on rolling stock and construction of
OHE.
**If the income flows are computed from the date of
completion of the project, the capital outlay will be
compounded at the desired interest rate.
Given these assumptions, the financial cost cash-flows associated
with the two illustrative traction alternatives can be presented in the
following manner :
Financial cost to Railways (Rs. crores).
Year Diesel Electric
1 .. 3.0
2 0.5 6.0
3 0.5 15.0
4 10.0 6.0
5th to 44th (each year) 4.0 2.5
Discounted Present Worth of Financial Costs.
Interest Rate. Diesel Electric
6% 56.5 55.3
7% 49.2 50.3
It would be seen that when discounted at 6 per cent the present worth of the
financial cost flow relating to electrification works out to be lower than that of the
financial cost flow associated with dieselisation by Rs. 1.2 crores. But the situation
is reversed when the cost flows are discounted at 7 per cent, in which case
dieselisation turns out to be cheaper by Rs. 1.1 crores. Thus, in this hypothetical
case, the depreciation inclusive financial cost of electrification is lower only at
rates of interest below 7 per cent. The rate of interest at which the two
alternatives will impose identical costs can be found out by linear interpolation.

This turns out to be 6.5 percent; at lower rates of interest electrification is the
cheaper alternative; but becomes the costlier one at interest rates exceeding 6.5
per cent. This is as it should be; for electrification is the more capital intensive
mode of traction.
The estimation of cash-flows relevant for the computation of the cost to
the economy is based on the following assumptions :-
(i) The basic price, inflated to the extent of 50 per cent of the
excise duty, is taken as the appropriate scarcity value of high-
speed diesel oil.
(ii) The cost to the economy of electricity generation and transmission
is assumed to be 7 paise per KWH as compared to 10 paise per
KWH assumed to be actually paid by the railways.
(iii) Fuel costs constitute 70 per cent of operating expenses under
diesel and 50 per cent of operating expenses under electric
traction.
Under these assumptions, the cost to the economy of the uniform annual
operating expenses associated with dieselisation and electrification works out to
be Rs. 3.00 and Rs. 2.12 crores respectively. But, the cost to the economy of
capital outlays continues to be the same as the financial cost. The discounted
present worth of the cash flow corresponding to the cost to the economy at 3 and
4 percent interest rates is as follows:
Discounted Present Worth of Costs to the Economy.
Interest Rate Diesel Electric
3% 71.4 70.8
4% 60.2 62.4
It will be seen from the above that in this hypothetical case, from the point of
view of cost to the economy, electrification turns out to be cheaper than
dieselisation only at rates of interest which do not exeed 4 per cent. The break
even rate of interest, at which both alternatives involve identical costs, is

The examples given below are intended to illustrate the principles set out in paragraph 238 et
seq. The data assumed are hypothetical and the conclusions arrived at in these examples are
purely illustrative. The methods adopted are not to be regarded as exhaustive or as precluding
the use of alternative methods which may be found to be more appropriate.
1. Renewal of a Locomotive.-
(i) Whether to recondition or to renew a locomotive, given the following data :-
Particulars. Old Locomotive. New Locomotive
Cost of the locomotive Rs. 50,000 Rs. 5,00,000
(Second-hand cost). (New cost).
Cost of reconditioning Rs. 50.000 .......
Rate of interest 10 percent. 10 percent.
Life 10 years 40 years
Scrap Value Rs. 10,000 Rs. 20,000
Maintenance Operation and Rs. 50,000 a year. Rs. 40,000 a year
Repair Charges
(ii) The average annual cost of the existing locomotive after reconditioning would be Rs.
65,643 made up of the following :-
Rs.
(a) Cost of maintenance, operation, repairs, etc. 50,000
(b) Interest at 10 per cent on Rs. 1,00,000 (Rs. 50,000 10,000
Plus Rs. 50,000)
(c) Sinking Fund Payment at 10 per cent (90,000 x 5,643
0.0627)
Total 65,643
(iii) The average annual cost of the new locomotive would be Rs. 95,104 made up of the
following:-
Rs.
(a) Cost of maintenance, operation, repairs, etc. 40,000
(b) Interest at 10 per cent on Rs.5,40,000 (i.e., new 54,000
cost Rs.5,00,000+ the second hand cost of the
old locomotive, Rs.50,000- the scrap value of
old locornotive Rs. 10,000).
(c) Sinking Fund Payment at 10 per cent 1,104
(4,80,000 x 0.0023).
Total 95,104

(iv) It follows from the above figures that, with the data assumed, it is cheaper to
recondition the old locomotive than to replace it by a new one.
(v) Applying the DCF method also, it is observed that for an initial investment of
Rs. 5 lakhs, the NPV for 40 years on the basis of the saving of Rs.10,000/- reckoned at
10 per cent p.a. adds up to Rs.1,02,210 only (10,000x9.779)+(20,000x0.0221). The
purchase of new locomotive is, therefore, not justified.

Total 2,891
(iv) It follows that reconditioning is cheaper.
3. Renewal of Permanent Way- (i) To determine whether a line of 85 lb. B. H. rails should be
fitted with 2 additional sleepers, one, Duplex joint sleeper and new fish-plates and bolts, or
replaced with 90 lb. F. F. rails, given the following data :-
For providing additional fittings. Fitting new 901b.rails
Cost of two additional sleepers including fittings Rs 60 Cost of 2 new 90 lbs. rails Rs.550
Cost of Duplex joint sleepers including fittings 64 Including carriage and laying.....

Second-hand cost of two 85 lb. rails, 36 ft. long. 243
Rate of interest 10 per cent
Note -(1) Maintenance and repair cost are considered to be the same in both cases.
(2) Steel scrap has a very high price in the market and new rails are comparatively
cheap from indigenous sources.
(3) The old rails cannot be used elsewhere.
(ii) The average annual cost of service of the existing 85 lb. track after additional fittings
are made will be Rs.26.27 vide calculations below:-
(a) Interest at 10 per cent on the—

Total 68.90
(iv) With the data assumed it is cheaper to provide 2 extra sleepers 1 Duplex Point sleepers
and new fish- plates and bolts to the existing track than to replace it with 90 lb. F. F. rails.
If, however, it were possible to use the B. H. rails elsewhere on the line, it might be cheaper
to provide new rails than to provide these additional fittings.
4. Re-alignment of Line.-(i) To determine whether the re-alignment of a track by
abandoning the arc and following the chord, is justifiable, given the following data :-
Length of arc 15 miles
Length of
10 miles
chord Cost of
chord Rs. 5,00,000
Scrap value of items recoverable from the
Rs. 50,000
arc Scrap value of items recoverable from
Rs. 40,000
the chord Second-hand value of all assets
of the arc Savings in operation and Rs. 3,00,000
maintenance costs Loss on tickets owing to
Rs. 70,000
reduction of mileage Extra traffic expected.
Rate of interest. Rs. 10,000
Rs. 15,000
10 per cent
Note.-There is keen bus competition on the section running along the arc and the chord will
cut this competition as the road runs along the arc and not the chord, and it is very unlikely
another road will be built along the chord.

(ii) The net saving due to re-alignment is Rs.75000 (70,000-10,000+ 15,000).
(iii) The average annual cost excluding the cost of operation and maintenance of the
realigned track will be Rs.76,702 vide calculations below.-
Rs.
(a) Interest on Rs. 7,50,000 (i.e. Rs. 5,00,000 + Rs. 3,00,000 75,000
- Rs. 50,000) at 10 per cent.
(b) Sinking Fund Payment at 10 percent required to provide 1,702
Rs.4,60,000 (i. e.5,00,000 -Rs.40,000) at the end of 35 years -
(0.0037 x 4,60,000)
Total 76,702
Note.-There are many assets on the track having varying normal lives. For the purpose of
this calculation, a life of 35 years has been taken as a fair average for all the assets
involved.
iv) Hence it may be seen that realignment is not justified since, it will involve an excess of
Rs.1,702 p. a.

ANNEXURE-H
(See Paragraph 242)
The examples given below are intended to illustrate the principle set out in
paragraph 241 The data assumed are hypothetical and the results arrived at in these
examples are purely illustrative.
1. If, in the case of an asset where the average annual cost of service is the basis
on which the second hand value has to be fixed.-
the normal life is N years.
the first cost is Rs. C

scrap value of Rs.2,500, the rate of interest is 3 percent or .03 per rupee and the average
maintenance and repair cost for the first 20 years is Rs.250 and for the next 40 years
Rs.35O, then applying the above formula, the second-hand value at the end of 20 years
will be.

average operation, maintenance and repairs costs while new, Rs. 1,20,000 per annum and
the average operation, maintenance and repairs costs in the second-hand condition Rs.
1,03,000 per annum; and if, the average serviceability of the asset while new be 1,20,000

ANNEXURE – I
Railway Project Economic Appraisal Framework Note
1. Comprehensive Economic IRR approach factoring Network effect
Project economic analysis aims at ensuring efficient allocation of scarce resources and
raising the welfare of its citizens, so that it benefits the country as a whole. All resource
investments have an opportunity cost because, if the resource is not allocated to the
project, it will create value elsewhere in the economy.
The Philosophy of economic valuation of railway investments is indicated in the Annexure
“F” of Chapter II, Indian Railway Financial Code (Vol-1). Some of the fundamental principles
on which economic evaluation of Railway investments should be carried out are as follows:
• Economic benefits attributable to a particular investment can, for a number of reasons,
exceed the revenues directly accruing to the Railways in the form of fare and freight
receipts.
• Rail transportation can make a substantial indirect contribution as well to general
wellbeing by facilitating economic expansion. A new line, in a backward region not well
endowed with alternative modes of transportation, stimulates the growth of output and
employment by widening the market for local products as well as by creating a market
for some hitherto unexploited natural resource. The quantification of such indirect
benefits can at best be approximative.
• Great care should be taken in estimating social benefits for the purpose of economic
appraisal of railway investments. Such benefits should, to the extent possible, be
quantified with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Thorough investigations at the traffic
survey stage would help in identifying the "developmental effects" and in estimating
broadly the magnitude the complementary investments that may be required.
• The expenditure flows associated with Railway projects can, to varying extents, diverge
from the cost to the economy of acquiring resources needed for their implementation
and operation. The prices at which certain inputs and resources are made available to
the Railways, for instance, may understate or exaggerate their real cost to the
economy.
It is, however, noticed that different methods are being used for the economic valuation of
railway investments. With a view to standardise the procedure, and bring clarity, a
comprehensive approach for economic IRR analysis of Indian Railway Line Projects is
indicated below.
It is pertinent to highlight that as prescribed in above code viz. “Thorough investigations at
the traffic survey stage would help in identifying the "developmental effects”, it is critical
that traffic studies are based on required primary and secondary data. A brief guidance on
traffic demand assessment based on various primary and secondary data is appended as ‘D’.
102

It is clarified that this note is applicable only for mainline projects viz. new line or multi-
tracking projects.
1.1. Basis adopted for EIRR Analysis
For the appraisal of a Railway project proposal, the economic IRR analysis should be done
based on various parameters such as the project’s economic benefits, economic costs, and
sensitivity analysis (against variation in key project parameters) to assess economic rationale
and economic viability on the basis of project life cycle costs. The approach, prescribed
herein, takes into account a number of direct and indirect benefits to be accounted for in the
economic cost benefit analysis, in line with national and global relevant best practices
(MoUHA, MoRTH and ADB). The proposed approach also considers the recommendations
from the report prepared by Multi- disciplinary Committee of Additional Members on
Comprehensive Project Appraisal System for sanctioning new projects by factoring in the
"Network Effect". The framework takes certain assumptions from the MoUHA guidelines, and
these guidelines are taken as a base as it is updated from time to time and accepted across
national infrastructure projects. This note aims at providing a comprehensive approach to
analyse economic IRR of Indian Railway Line Projects.
1.2. Proposed Economic IRR analysis framework
Figure 1 Proposed Economic IRR analysis framework
Railway projects provide larger economic and social benefits to the society in terms of
reduction in cost and time of travel, a substantial reduction in emissions reducing chronic
diseases, reduction in road accidents, etc. A railway project improves mobility of people and
efficiency of commodity flow by providing seamless connectivity with the rest of network. In
103

addition, new railway projects can also influence the existing rail network and create
benefits outside the local area of the project depending upon the scale and size of the
project. This can be referred to as “Network effects”.
The proposed economic IRR analysis framework incorporates Direct and Indirect benefits of
the project, factoring network effects. The methodology and source list for the proposed
economic analysis framework is summarized and given below (A,B,C,D).
A) Steps for Calculating Economic IRR factoring Network effect
The steps in economic analysis are as described below:
Step 1: Define Project Horizon
The project horizon comprises of construction and operation period of the Railway project.
During the project horizon, the cost and benefits associated with the project should be
estimated. The horizon period for the purpose of economic analysis may be taken as 30
years in line with codal life of track assets as per para 219, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of Indian
Railway Finance Code.
Step 2: Develop Alternative Scenarios
This step involves development of alternative project scenarios to which a comparison with
the project case that is undertaken is to be made. For example, economic cost and benefits
of undertaking a Railway project (“With Project”) are to be compared with the base case i.e.
“Without Project” or “Do Nothing” scenario or any other alternative project in order to arrive
at incremental costs and benefits.
Step 3: Determine Economic Cost of the Project
The steps involved in determining the Economic Cost of the project are specified below:
Table 1 Steps for estimating Economic Cost of Project
Steps Methodology
The Project cost covers both the implementation period of major investments
and operating years, known as the project operating life. Costs are measured in
Project
constant prices of a base year. The Project Cost includes:
Cost12
, 1. Capital Cost
2. Operations and Maintenance Cost
1 Capital replacement cost has not been assumed in the project cost during the Economic IRR calculation. In
case it is assumed, the project horizon period needs to be extended accordingly to account for benefits over
replaced asset’s life horizon. Accordingly, it is recommended that the project horizon should be equal to the
prescribed life of asset as per the applicable IR code.
2 Rolling stock cost is not assumed in the project cost during the Economic IRR calculation, given that the
rolling stock is not dedicated to the project.
104

The economic costs of the capital works and annual operation and maintenance
costs are calculated from the financial cost estimates using economic conversion
factors given in table 1 to exclude the impact of:
Project
1. Price contingencies/price escalations
Economic
2. Import duties and taxes
Cost
3. Sunk costs
4. Interest payment, principal payment and interest during the construction
period.

Step 4: Estimation of Economic Benefits of the Project
Year wise project benefits should be estimated during the project operation period. The
“With project” scenario should be compared with the option of “Without project” scenario to
determine the incremental economic benefits. The economic benefits of the projects should
capture the economic and social network impact on any railway project.
The following quantifiable benefits are accrued to the society owing to implementation of
the Railway project.
Direct and Indirect Benefits Network Benefits
Travel Time Savings (VOT) Reduction in Emissions (Environmental impact)
Vehicle Operating Costs Savings (VOC) Reduction in Fuel and Economic impact
Reduction in Accidents Railway Network Decongestion
Infrastructure Maintenance Cost Savings Reduction in delayed travelling time (Network)
Road Infrastructure Cost Savings Increase in Railway Throughput (Network)
Employment Generation
a) Direct and Indirect benefits
The railway investments provide substantial direct and indirect benefits to the economy. The
components and steps involved in determining the direct and indirect economic benefits are:
i) Travel Time Savings (VOT)
Railway projects significantly contribute to modal shift owing to higher speeds and comfort
to passengers. This leads to travel time savings for passengers travelling on rail system over
the existing transport modes because of faster speed of Railway.
The formula for calculation of travel time savings is presented below.

ii) Vehicle Operating Cost Savings (VOC)
Vehicle operating costs (VOCs) are the cost to the owner of operating a motor vehicle.
Savings in vehicle operating costs of different modes arise due to a decrease in the number
of vehicle trips on the roads. The VOC cost varies based on vehicle type (2-wheelers, 3-
wheelers, cars, buses or any other prevalent mode) and is calculated using the equations
and guidelines given in the “Manual on Economic Evaluation of Highway Projects in India,
2019” by the Indian Road Congress (IRC).
The formula for calculation of travel time savings is presented below.

iii) Reduction in Accidents
The reduction in traffic volumes on roads due to the modal shift to rail is expected to reduce
road accidents on the project corridor. Reduction in accidents will lead to saving of lives,
reduction in damages to vehicles and savings towards medical, insurance expenses,
administrative expenses on police and the intangible psychosomatic cost of pain to people
involved in the accidents and their families.
The economic benefits due to the reduction in accidents are calculated as follows:

much.

iv) Infrastructure Maintenance Cost Savings
Infrastructure Maintenance Cost Savings will arise due to reduced need for maintenance of
the existing road infrastructure owing to reduced traffic on account of modal shift. The
benefits can be calculated using the reduction in vehicle kilometres due to modal shift and
the road infrastructure maintenance cost per km.

v) Road Infrastructure Cost Savings
Additional road infrastructure or upgrading the existing road infrastructure will be required
to solve the congestion problem and accommodate growth in traffic in case the railway line
is not introduced. The new railway line will bring savings in investment in road infrastructure
due to shifting of passengers to Rail and withdrawal of vehicles in the project corridor.
The road infrastructure savings will be calculated using the below formula.

vi) Employment Generation
During the period of construction, manpower will be needed for various project activities. In
post-construction phase, manpower will be employed for the operation and maintenance of
the system. Thus, the project would provide substantial direct employment. In addition to
these, more people would be indirectly employed in allied activities.

b) Network Benefits
Railway investments can influence the entire railway network and generates Network
benefits in terms of reduction in environmental impact due to a decrease in emissions,
reduction in railway network congestion and improvement in travel time reliability etc. The
components and steps involved in determining the economic benefits factoring network
effects are:
i) Reduction in Emissions
Railway projects significantly contribute to pollution reduction, and these should be
considered in economic analysis. The significant environmental savings come from decrease
in air pollution associated with existing non-railway traffic due to the modal shift from the
existing modes of transport to rail.
The reduction in emissions will be calculated based on the decrease in vehicle kilometres,
volume of pollutants emitted from different modes and the cost of treatment per ton.

ii) Reduction in Fuel and economic impact
Reduction in the number of vehicles on the roads and decongestion effect with the
construction of new railway line gives benefits to the economy in terms of reduction in fuel
consumption. A decrease in fuel consumption will result in a reduction in the import of crude
oil.

iii) Railway Network Decongestion
Construction of a new railway line will reduce congestion on the existing line or section of
the rail network and will help in improving line capacity of the section. This will also reduce
the lead time of trains moving via new railway line instead of moving via existing rail route.
The savings due to the railway network decongestion can be calculated using the below

iv) Reduction in delayed travelling time (Travel Time Reliability)
Travel time reliability refers to reaching the destination in a consistent journey time.
Construction of a new railway line will result in an improvement in travel time reliability due
to the reduction in rail congestion and predictability of travel time. The value of travel time
reliability is estimated from the reduced travel time variability and associated buffer time
that passengers have allowed before making trips. The savings due to the travel time
reliability or reduction in delayed travel time will be calculated using the below formula.

v) Increase in Railway Throughput
Construction of a new railway line will result in additional passenger traffic on the rail
network due to a reduction in travel time and an increase in the number of choices for a
passenger. The economic benefit due to the increase in the railway throughout can be
calculated using increase in passenger traffic and average revenue generated per
passenger.

Step 5: Economic conversion factors
The financial cost and benefits of the railway project are converted to economic cost and
benefits using economic conversion factor. Economic conversion factors are used to adjust
for taxes, subsidies, inefficient land or wage markets, and other transfer payments, before
performing the economic analysis. The conversion factors for different categories are given
in Table 1.

Step 6: Economic Analysis Output
The outputs of economic analysis are calculated using two parameters.
1. Economic Net Present Value (ENPV)– ENPV is the sum of differences between the
discounted benefits and cost flows.
2. Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR)– EIRR is the discount rate at which the ENPV
becomes zero.
110

Step 7: Sensitivity Analysis
The range of sensitivity can be carried out to see the impact of change in critical parameters
in the range of 5% to 20% on EIRR. The critical factors such as
1. Cost overruns due to delay or other factors
2. Increase in Operations and Maintenance Cost
3. Reduction in passenger traffic
4. Reduction in economic benefits

D) Demand assessment methodology
Demand assessment for Railway traffic requires a combination of activities such as hinterland
demarcation, extensive field surveys, primary interactions with the stakeholders and other
required research towards developing a base year demand matrix and undertaking demand
projections. The methodology for the demand assessment is given below:
Task 1: Delineation of project influence area/ hinterland
The first task would be to identify influence areas/hinterland for the planned railway line, as
well as accompanying port and industrial clusters. The influence zone within all states through
which the proposed corridor would pass needs to be evaluated for the purpose of identifying
the hinterland.
Based on extensive review of assessing passenger and freight movement on rail corridors, the
hinterland/catchment area of rail corridors can typically be categorized into:
a) Primary hinterland: which includes end to end network of the proposed corridor
including originating point, terminating point, all key regions falling along the corridor, or
within a 150 km range from the corridor
b) Secondary hinterland: which includes regions from which cargo is either originating or
terminating on the corridor, and
c) Tertiary hinterland: which includes region from which cargo is neither originating nor
terminating on the proposed corridor but passing through the significant part of the
corridor. It may be noted that only such regions will be considered under tertiary
hinterland, wherein significant amount of cargo is currently moving from/to.
While identifying the hinterland, the study team should also consider main feeder lines
connecting to the proposed corridor alignment. Further, in case, proposed corridor is expected
to connect to ports, hinterland of identified ports should also be considered.
Task 2: Assessment of Base year demand
The next task would be to assess the base year traffic in the project hinterland. For this, traffic
moving across different modes (road, railways and IWT) needs to be assessed. A robust data
collection strategy combining primary and secondary surveys should by used to carve out the
base year demand.

Petrol sales data Petrol Pump operators
expanding daily traffic to average annual
daily traffic (AADT).
Reports/ studies/ guidelines published by IWAI, NHAI and any other government and multilateral
agencies for assessing financial and economic costs.
Transport demand projections
Demand for transport is a derived demand, and therefore, it depends on how the transport-
requiring industry grows over time. A top-down assessment needs to be undertaken for
projecting transport demand. It will start with a compilation of existing transport demand,
which will be informed by section 1.2. The transport demand must be projected based on
appropriate macroeconomic indicators, past trends and econometric models to arrive at
projected transport demand for a period upto 20-30 years from the baseline year. Along with
this there needs to be a holistic review of industry plans, upcoming SEZs and other proposed
traffic intensive activities in the catchment. All such inputs must factor in during transport
projections.
Rail transport demand is a subset of the transport demand projections. Hence, rail modal share
for future years can be estimated based on mode choice models (based on time and cost
analysis) and outputs from stated preference surveys in section 1.2.1.

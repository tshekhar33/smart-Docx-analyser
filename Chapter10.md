the department such as charges on account of taxi hire.
ii) unusual charges that require the special sanction of competent authority
such as entertainment expenses on special occasions.
Note-1- The expenditure on entertainment/refreshment at important
meetings/conferences etc. will be regulated by the instructions issued by the
Railway Board from time to time. The General Manager, in consultations with
FA&CAO, may re-delegate his powers for incurrence of expenditure on serving of
light refreshments such as plain coffee/tea/ cold drinks in conferences and
meetings with official/non-official visitors as are considered specially important and
unavoidable as far as the railway working is concerned.

non-official personages, representative of foreign technical associates,
foreign technical experts, and representatives of trade including overseas
companies.
ii) For the purpose of maintenance of cordial press and public relations to
project the Railway's image, expenditure by CPROs from Hospitality Fund
should be as per extant delegation. The General Manager, is however,
empowered to incur the expenditure as per extant delegation in special
circumstances where the need for such expenditure is imperative and in
the best interest of the press relations and commercial advertising works.
Such cases of enhanced expenditure should be rare and advised to the
Board.
iii) The expenditure to be incurred by Divisional Railway Managers on
entertainment/hospitality etc. will be as per extant delegation.

1043. Deleted.
1044. Bills for Contingent Expenditure.-Bills should be prepared separately for
ordinary and special contingencies. In regard to periodical charges and scale-
regulated contingencies, it should be stated when the charges were last incurred, to
enable the Accounts Officer to see that the expenditure has not been incurred
before the expiry of the prescribed period. The sanction of competent authority
7

should be quoted in cases in which superior sanction is necessary for incurring
expenditure. All contingent bills containing charges for miscellaneous supplies
should bear a certificate that the articles have been received in good condition and
entered in the stock account.
1045. Vouchers of contingent Expenditure –The limit below which vouchers
need not be forwarded to the Accounts office in support of the contingent bill
should be approved by the General Manager in consultation with Financial Adviser
and Chief Accounts Officer, but all vouchers which are not submitted to the
Accounts Office should be effaced and cancelled in such a way that they cannot be
used again in support of claim against the railway. All vouchers must be submitted
to the Accounts Office in support of the payment.
Note -The vouchers whether sent with the bill or retained in the office should be
certified as under by the executive/divisional officer-“Certified that in the case of
vouchers attached to the bill and those retained in my office relating to the
purchase of goods made thereunder and the amounts paid on account of GST on
those goods are correct under the provisions of that Act or the Rules made
thereunder and in case of supplies against regular contracts, the relevant contract
includes a specific provision that GST is payable by Government”.
1046. Duties of the Drawing Officer –The drawing officer is expected to
exercise the same vigilance over contingent expenditure as a person of ordinary
prudence would exercise in spending his own money. He should further see that
the vouchers are in proper form, have been receipted by the proper person and
have been so made out that a second claim against the railway for the same charge
is impossible, that the expenditure is absolutely necessary for the efficient
management of the office or the performance of the service to which it relates, that
the rates are not uneconomical, that the sanction of higher authority is not required
under the financial restrictions laid down in any rules or orders issued by competent
authority and, where necessary, the requisite sanction is obtained and quoted in
the bill in support of the charge and that adequate budget provision exists to cover
the expenditure involved.
1047. Disbursement of contingent charges –Contingent charges are disbursed
in the following ways -
i) Payment by the officer incurring the expenditure out of imprest or
permanent advance allowed to him.
ii) Payment by the Accounts Officer direct to the supplier, on the authority of
the officer competent to incur the expenditure and on receipt of proof of
8

supply. In such cases, the firm’s bill and receipt should be sent in original
to the Accounts Office.
iii) Payment by the head of the office on receipt of money from the Accounts
Office:
No money should be obtained from the Accounts Office unless it is
required for immediate disbursement and adjustment bills supported by
necessary vouchers and payee’s receipts should be sent to the Accounts
Office immediately after disbursement.
iv) Book adjustment by the Accounts Office when supplies have been made
by another department of the railway, or another railway or a department
or Ministry of the Government of India, provided the charges have been
acknowledged by the offices concerned.
In such cases the rules of adjustment prescribed by supplying
departments should be followed. If any such rules prescribe cash
payment, the procedure will be as in (ii) above. For supplies from the
Railway Stores or other Railway Departments the rules on the subject
should be followed.
v) The charges for service postage stamps are drawn on separate contingent
bill forms in the usual way, and separate cheques therefore are issued by
the Accounts Officer in favour of the officer who supplies the stamps.
Cheques so issued are not subject to any special minimum amount.
1048. Control over Contingent Expenditure -A register of contingent
expenditure should be kept in each office, analysing the amount charged to the
head "office contingencies" in such detail and under such sub-heads as may be
considered necessary for the control of expenditure. The contingencies register
should be examined at least once a month by an officer and if there are signs of
extravagance under any sub-head of contingencies these should be investigated
and steps taken to restrict the expenditure under those sub-heads. The following
are amongst the items which should be watched in this way -
i) Stationery and forms and printing charges.
ii) Telephones.
iii) Hire and purchase of office equipment.
iv) Hot and cold weather charges.
v) Uniforms.
vi) Conveyance hire
Note -The cost of electric energy (whether generated in a Railway Power House or
purchased in bulk from an outside source and distributed by the railway), the
expenditure on the maintenance and repairs of telephone instruments and
apparatus provided by the railway at its own cost and the rent paid to Government
9

Telegraph Department on account of wires provided by that department are not
treated as contingent charges and will be finally charged to Abstracts E, F and H.
Where, however, telephones are obtained on hire from the Government Telegraph
Department or private companies the charges paid on account of rent and trunk
calls shall be treated as contingent expenditure and debited to office contingencies.
1049. The control of expenditure against the budget allotment for "office
contingencies" should be exercised by the Heads of Departments and Divisional
Railway Manager with the help of the Allocation Register maintained in the accounts
Office. In the case of other railway offices, such control will be exercised by the
officers to whom such a grant may be given through the registers of expenditure
maintained by them.
1050. An imprest is a standing advance of a fixed sum of money placed at the
disposal of an individual to meet the following types of expenditure:
1) Petty Office expenses.
2) Cost of raw materials for the diet of indoor patients of hospitals.
3) Emergent charges which cannot be foreseen.
4) Other petty expenses as per extant delegation in each case. Emergency
petty advances may also be made on the responsibility of the imprest
holder out of imprest money placed at his disposal.
A certificate to be recorded by the procuring official/Imprest holder in the following
format:
"I,, am personally satisfied that these goods purchased are of the requisite quality
and specification and have been purchased from a reliable supplier at a reasonable
price."
1051. The amount of an imprest must not be larger than is absolutely necessary.
It should be reckoned at the lowest possible figure calculated to suffice for meeting
charges of the nature referred to in the preceding paragraph and should be fixed in
consultation with the Accounts Officer who will advise as to the appropriate amount
of the imprest.
1052. Subject to the provisions of the previous paragraph, the General Manager of
a railway will have full power to sanction imprests. He may re-delegate his power in
this respect to authorities subordinate to him on such conditions as he may think fit
to impose. In the case of other offices, the grant of an imprest will require the
sanction of the competent authority as decided by Railway Board.
10

1053. The number of imprests should not be multiplied unnecessarily. An officer's
imprest should meet the needs of every branch of his office. If he has subordinates
who require petty sums, he should rather spare a small portion of his own imprest
for their use than apply for separate imprest for them, taking acknowledgements
from them in the same way as he himself furnishes to the Accounts Officer and
retaining them in his office.
1054. The responsibility for making proper arrangements for the safe custody of
the imprest money rests entirely with the imprest holder and he must at all times
be ready to produce the total amount of the imprest in vouchers or in cash.
1055. The imprest account should be kept in duplicate, the counterfoil being kept
by the imprest holder and the original, supported by the necessary vouchers,
forwarded to the Accounts Officer from time to time as the holder of the imprest
may require it to be replenished. The account should be closed ordinarily on the
27th of each month and recouped before the end of the month so as to ensure as
many of the month's transactions as possible being included in the account. The
imprest should be recouped once in a month only.
1056. Imprest Card -Few National Banks have launched imprest card scheme for
handling Imprest under which imprest card holders are given a card with fixed
amount. Imprest card holder receives transactions messages through SMS. Since
the imprest card eliminates handling of cash and is a safer and more reliable
system, it may be actively used by the Railways. It will also bring efficiency in the
system. Guidelines issued by Ministry of Finance (Department of Expenditure) vide
OM dated 14.07.2021 for use of prepaid debit cards for permanent imprest and
contingent Advance in Ministry/Department, may be referred. Accounts Directorate
of Railway Board has also issued guidelines in this regard.

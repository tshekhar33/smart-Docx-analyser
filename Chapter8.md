CHAPTER-VIII
Inter Railway And Inter Departmental Service
Incidence of Pay and Allowances
801. Transfers within the Railways or offices under the Ministry of Railways-
The transit pay and allowances of a railway servant proceeding to join an office within
the Railways or under the administrative control of Ministry of Railways are charged to
the office to which he is proceeding.
802. Permanent Transfers to and from other Departments/Ministries- The
transit pay and allowances of a person transferred permanently to or from another
Department/Ministry of the Central Government or State Government are charged to
the Department/Ministry or Government he is proceeding to join.
803. Temporary Transfers to and from Other Departments/Ministries- A
person transferred to foreign service, or temporarily lent to or borrowed from a State
Government, another Department/Ministry of the Central Government, draws his
emoluments from the foreign employer or the borrowing authority from the date on
which he relinquishes charge of his duties under the lending authority to the date he
resumes charge of duties under the latter authority.
Note -The pay and allowances, including travelling allowance of a railway servant
summoned to give evidence in his official capacity in a criminal court or in a civil court
in a case in which government is party, are, during the period of his absence, debited to
the railway which would bear the charge if he were on duty.
804. Leave and joining Time Combined with Transfers- The provisions of
paragraphs 801 to 803 apply also in cases where the person concerned takes leave
either before joining the new office or before rejoining the lending party.
805. Employment of Armed Forces Units -When Armed Forces units are required
to perform duties in aid of the Railways, the incidence of expenditure is governed by
the following rules :-
1) For Maintenance of Law and Order - All expenditure on the
employment of Armed Forces will be borne by the Ministry of Defence.
3

2)
a) For maintenance of essential services.
b) For assistance during natural calamities.
c) Assistance in the execution of development projects.
No recovery will be made from the Railway Administration on account of-
i) Normal pay and allowance and rations of service personnel of units which
may be made available from within the order of battle. However, in cases
where additional units are maintained by retaining the units due to
disbandment or by raising new units specifically to meet the requirements
of the Railway(s) the entire cost of these units will be charged to the
Project for recovery from the Railway Administration(s). Accommodation,
water etc., would, however, be provided for these personnel by the
Railway Administrations, if required.
ii) Clothing, equipment, vehicles etc., used by troops.
iii) Supervision charges or interest on the capital value of these articles.
3) Payment will, however, be made by the Railway Administration(s) in
respect of the following :-
i) Consumable stores including P. O. L. -The entire cost at payment
issue rates.
ii) Non-consumable stores and equipment –
a) Depreciation assessed on the replacement cost on account of
wear and tear. For aircraft, depreciation will be calculated on
the original cost.
b) Cost of repairs and maintenance.
c) Cost of replacement of equipment rendered unserviceable as a
result of such use. The assessment will be made having regard
to its condition before its use on the project. In the case of
aircraft, normal strike off wastage element only will be included
in the charges irrespective of the actual rate of accident.
iii) Incidental expenditure necessitated by the work e.g., cost of move of
units, personnel and equipment to and from the site of work and extra
allowances, rations, clothing and amenities where provided.
4

Pensionary liability in respect of any accident to troops will be that of the
Ministry of Defence. For this purpose troops will be treated on duty. Any
damage to crops or compensation payable to civilians would, however, be
the responsibility of the Railway Administration concerned.
4) Any other type of Assistance -Complete cost of the Armed Force including
ordinary pay and allowances , cost of transport, equipment including loss and
repair expenses etc., and extraordinary charges in the shape of special pay or
transportation of stores will be payable by the Railway Administration.
Pensionary liability in respect of casualties occurring due to employment of the
troops with the Railways will be that of the Railway Administration concerned,
who will also be liable for a proportionate share of service pension/gratuity on a
service share basis.
806. When soldiers are sent under Military escort from one station to another to stand
trial on a criminal charge, they will travel like any other party of soldiers on duty, under
a warrant furnished by the Military authorities, the charge being met from the Defence
Services Estimates. When a soldier is conducted by a Police escort, the charge will be
Civil; the warrant issued in such cases should include the accused as he is a soldier
proceeding to a certain place under the orders of his Military Superior and therefore on
duty.
807. Army in India Reserve of Officers -Railway servants, who belong to the Army
in India Reserve of Officers, when called up for training, receive the emoluments stated
in paragraphs 808 to 812 below.
808. When proceeding to carry out their training direct from their civil appointments,
they draw the pay and allowances, which they would have drawn in their civil
appointments but for the training, for the whole period of absence on such training
inclusive of the time spent in transit to and fro.
809. When proceeding to carry out their training while on leave in India, they draw
the civil leave pay and allowances which they would have drawn but for the training.
810. For the period of actual training, they receive the military pay and allowances.
811. The emoluments drawn under paragraphs 808 and 809 are debitable to the
Railway and those under paragraph 810 to the Defence estimates.
5

812. If it is necessary to provide a substitute in the place of such an officer
undergoing training, the additional cost will be a charge against Railway estimates.
813. Reservists of the Indian Army -Reservists of the Indian Army in railway
employ when called up for periodical military training will receive military pay and
allowances. They will also receive the excess, if any, of their civil pay under the ‘next
below' rule over their military pay and allowances. Any extra expenditure involved will
be charged to the Railway and not to the Defence estimates.
Note -The intention of the 'next below' rule is that a railway servant, out of his regular
line should not suffer by forfeiting acting promotion which he would otherwise have
received had he remained in his regular line. The fortuitous acting promotion of some
one junior to a railway servant who is out of the regular line will not in itself give rise to
a claim under the next below rule. Before such a claim is established it should be
necessary that all the railway servants senior to the railway servant who is out of the
regular line have been given acting promotion, and also the railway servant next below
him, unless in any case the acting promotion is not given because of inefficiency,
unsuitability or leave. In the event of one of these three bars being applicable to the
railway servant immediately below the railway servant outside his regular line, then
some other railway servant, even more junior, should have received acting promotion
and the railway servants, if any, in between should have been passed over for one of
these reasons.
814. For the purpose of paragraph 813, the civil pay in relation to running staff should
be held to mean pay proper under the ‘next below’ rule plus a fixed percentage not
exceeding 30 percent, representing the normal running allowance drawn by each
category of staff under present day conditions.
815. The orders contained in the preceding paragraph do not apply to cases, if any, in
which the civil pay of the reservist is met from the Defence estimates.
816. Territorial Army (Non-railway Units) -Railway servants who are allowed to
enroll in the Non-railway Units of the Territorial Army, when called up for training and
military duty, receive the emoluments as stated below –
i) During the period of training they will receive pay and allowances
according to their ranks. Military pay and allowances received by railway
servants will be in addition to their civil emoluments. During the periods
spent in Camp, they should be allowed to receive their civil pay and
allowances in respect of this period in addition to pay and allowances
which they receive from the Defence Services Estimates;
6

ii) When called out for military duty in aid of civil power or when embodied
under the Territorial Army Act, 1948, or the Territorial Army Act Rules
1948 they will receive the military pay and allowance to which they would
be entitled in respect of military duty. They will also receive the excess, if
any, of their civil pay and allowances under the 'next below' rules over
their military pay and allowances. The extra expenditure involved shall
constitute a charge against the railway under the ordinary head of
expenditure to which the pay of the individual concerned is debitable.
817. Territorial Army (Railway Units) - The provisions in the preceding paragraph
will apply in the case of railway servants enrolled or commissioned in the Railway Units
of the Territorial Army subject to the following additional concessions being given to the
embodied personnel during the period of their embodiment-
a) The actual average overtime, piecework profits and night allowances should
be permitted to be drawn.
Note -The word 'average' used above should be taken to mean the monthly
average emoluments under those heads drawn during twelve months
immediately before the embodiment. In cases where the railway employee was
not eligible to draw these allowances for full twelve months before the
embodiment the monthly average should be worked out on the basis of the
period during which he was eligible for the allowances irrespective of whether
actually drawn any or not.
b) When Territorial Army (Railway Units) are embodied in aid of civil power,
allowances will be admissible at the following rates –
i) Officers will be eligible for double the rates and JCOs and other ranks other
than Running Staff for 1.75 times the rates of daily allowance to which
they are entitled in their civil appointment for the entire period they are
away from their civil headquarters without any limit to the period of stay at
a station. The daily allowance including the enhanced rates is also
admissible in cases where the headquarters of the embodied officers and
men remained the same as in civil posts prior to embodiments.
ii) Running Staff - Shunters and Firemen on shunting engines will be paid
kilometrage at 360 kms. per day while other running staff will be paid at
480 kms. per day in relaxation of the provision contained in Rule VIII (i) of
the Revised Running Allowance Rules as amended from time to time
irrespective of the fact that they are provided with free messing.
7

818. Admissibility of Allowances during study leave- Except for House Rent
Allowance and the Dearness Allowance, no other allowance shall be paid to a Railway
servant in respect of the period of study leave granted to him. The allowances paid to a
railway servant during study leave are charged to the railway on which he is employed
when the study leave is granted.
(Authority: Board’s Letter No.2011/F(E)III/2(2)/3 dated 11.10.2018 and E(P&A)II-
2002/HRA-2 dated 19.02.2002)
819. Compensatory Allowances during leave -House rent and other
Compensatory Allowances paid during leave are borne by the department to which the
officer is attached at the time he proceeds on leave.
Incidence Of Travelling Allowances
820. Transfers within the Railways or offices under the Ministry of Railways
-The travelling allowance of a railway servant proceeding to join an office within the
Railways or offices under the administrative control of the Ministry of Railways should,
in the absence of orders to the contrary be charged to the office to which he is
proceeding.
821. Permanent Transfers to or from other Departments/Ministries –The
travelling allowance of a Government servant permanently transferred to/or from
another Department/Ministry of the Central Government or State Government, is
debited to the Department/Ministry or Government to which he is transferred.
822. Temporary Transfers to or from other Departments/Ministries -A person
transferred to foreign service, or temporarily lent to or borrowed from a State
Government, another Department/Ministry of the Central Government, draws his
travelling allowances from the foreign employer or the borrowing party, both when,
proceeding to or reverting from service under the foreign employer or the borrowing
party.
823. Attendance at Courts -The travelling allowances of a railway servant called
away to give evidence in his official capacity in a criminal court, or in a civil court in a
case to which Government is a party, is debited to the railway which would bear the
charge if he were on duty, but any sum paid to him by the court is deducted from his
travelling allowance.
824. Journeys on behalf of private bodies -When a railway servant, permitted to
undertake work on behalf of a private individual or body or a public body, performs
8

journey in connection with such work the travelling expenses for the journey in
connection with such work will be a charge against the private individual or body. If the
railway servant travels on a free pass, the full cost of the pass for such journey should
be recovered from him and credited to railway revenues. Where a journey is made to a
station on private business combined with official business, the railway servant should
recover from the private party, the cost of a single journey from his headquarters, to
the place visited on the private employer's business and credit the same to railway
revenues.
Note -This paragraph does not apply to journeys undertaken in connection with the
business of Railway Institutes and Sports Clubs.
Incidence of Leave Salary
825. Persons exclusively employed in the Ministry of Railways, attached
offices of the Ministry of Railways, Zonal Railways, Production Units and
other offices subordinate to the Ministry of Railways - Except as provided in
paragraphs 826 and 827 below, the leave salary of a Railway servant, who has served
exclusively in the establishments mentioned above, will be debited to the office/Railway
Administration in which he may be serving at the time of proceeding on leave.
Provided that in the case of a Gazetted Railway servant proceeding on leave from a
post in the office of the Ministry of Railways or its attached offices, the Gazetted staff of
which is usually obtained from the Railways :-
i) If the officer in question holds a permanent non-tenure post in such an
office and is expected to return to that post at the end of the leave, or
proceeds on leave preparatory to retirement from such post on leave on
average or full pay only, the whole of the leave-salary should be debited
to that office. When the post held is a tenure post, the same orders will
apply provided that the leave taken does not extend beyond the period of
the tenure. In case the leave taken extends beyond the period of tenure,
the leave-salary upto the date of expiry of tenure or termination of lien if it
occurs earlier, should be debited to that office;
ii) If the officer does not hold a permanent post in the office and he proceeds
on leave on average pay not exceeding four months and is expected to
return to that office at the end of the leave, the leave-salary should be
debited to that office ; and
9

iii) In all other cases, the leave-salary should be debited to the railway on the
cadre of which his lien is borne.
826. Open line staff employed on constructions and surveys - An open line
railway servant, who proceeds on leave from a construction or survey, will be
considered as having reverted to the open line and his leave-salary will be charged
accordingly. As an exception to this rule, however, if the leave taken is for a period not
exceeding four months and he is posted to the same construction or survey on return
therefrom, his leave-salary should be charged to that construction or survey.
827. Persons in foreign service -The leave-salary in respect of leave taken by a
railway servant while in foreign service is borne by the railway which received the
contribution for leave-salary.
828. Persons with Service under different Departments / Ministries and
Governments -If a railway servant has served partly in the Railway
Department/Ministry and partly in a non-Railway Department/Ministry or under a State
Government, the leave-salary should be first debited to the borrowing
Departments/Ministries or Governments in the reverse order to that of employment and
only when the leave earned, by service in the borrowing departments/ministries and
Governments is exhausted it should be debited to the Railway Department/Ministry. The
same principle will apply if a Government servant belonging to another
Department/Ministry or State Government has served partly in the railway
Department/Ministry. The Railway share of the leave-salary will be charged to the
railway office in which he last served.
Note-
1) a) A lending Department/Ministry or Government is that under which a person first
obtains permanent employment. If he was previously holding a temporary
appointment under another Department/Ministry or Government, that
Department/Ministry or Government should be regarded as the borrowing
Department/Ministry or Government. If a person in the permanent service of
one Department/Ministry or Government is transferred permanently to another
Department/Ministry or Government, the latter should also be regarded as a
lending Department/Ministry or Government and the leave-salary adjusted
between the lending Departments/Ministries in the reverse order to that of
employment by which the leave was earned. An important corollary of this
principle is that when an officer of the Indian Army in permanent railway
employ is retransferred temporarily to the Defence Department/Ministry for war
10

work, etc., the Defence Department/Ministry should be regarded as a borrowing
Government.
b) The decision that the Government to which an officer is transferred is not to be
regarded as occupying the position of a lending Government unless and until
the officer obtain permanent employment under that Government is not
intended to apply to the temporary or officiating service of an officer under a
Government followed by confirmation for the first time under that Government
without interruption of duty. In such a case the temporary or officiating service
and the service after confirmation should be treated as forming one spell of
continuous service for the purpose of distribution of leave-salary and the
Government concerned should be regarded as a 'lending Government' for the
whole of the continuous service.
2) No share of the leave-salary of a railway servant belonging to the Army in India
Reserve of Officers, in respect of the leave earned during the period he is called out
for military training will be debitable to the Defence Service Estimates. Similarly, no
portion of the leave-salary of a railway servant, who is a member of the Territorial
Army, in respect of leave earned during the period he is called up for Military duty
will be debitable to the Defence Service Estimates.
3) Leave earned by service under the Government of Burma prior to separation will for
purposes of allocation be treated as earned under the Government under which the
officer concerned was permanently employed on the 1st April, 1937.
4) When the leave-salary of a railway servant has to be allocated under this rule
between an original lending Department/Ministry or Government (vide note 1
above) and a second lending Department/Ministry or Government, it should be
debited first to the second lending Department/ Ministry or Government to the full
extent of the leave earned under it and a debit to the first lending
Department/Ministry or Government will be made only when all leave earned under
the second lending Department/Ministry or Government has been exhausted.
Similarly if the leave-salary has to be allocated among three lending.
Departments/Ministries or Governments, the leave earned under the third or the
last lending Department/Ministry or Government will first be exhausted, then the
leave earned under the second and finally the leave earned under the first or
original lending Department/Ministry or Government. This principle of debit of
leave-salary according to the reverse order to that of employment shall also apply
when leave-salary has to be allocated among two or more borrowing
11

Departments/Ministries or Governments and in respect of different periods of
service rendered by a railway servant under a particular Department/ Ministry or
Government. In the latter case, the leave-salary in respect of the leave earned in
each period of service under the particular Department/Ministry or Government will
be dealt with separately
5) a) The leave-salary of an officer of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service, in
respect of service rendered in the Railway Audit and Accounts Offices, taken
together, will be debited to the Railway Department, Audit or Accounts, from
which the officer proceeds on leave. In the case of an officer who after having
served both in the Railway Audit and Accounts Department, reverts to the Civil
Department and takes leave from that Department, the railway portion of his
leave salary will be debited to the Railway Audit or Accounts Department in
which he was last employed before reversion to the Civil Department.
b) In the case of personnel temporarily lent from the Railway Accounts
Department to the Railway Audit Department, no adjustment of leave,
Provident Fund or Pension, etc., contributions should be made as the entire
cost of the Railway Audit is met from the railway estimates.
6) When a railway servant is granted an extension of service and the whole of the leave
at his credit on the date of compulsory retirement lapses under 2127-R and no leave is
carried forward on extension of service, the Government for whose benefits the
extension is sanctioned will bear the entire charge for leave-salary in respect of the
leave earned by him during the period of extension, any liability of any Government on
that date as shown in his subsidiary leave account being automatically cancelled. When,
however, such a railway servant carries forward any leave on extension of service, such
liability continues, but only in respect of the leave actually carried forward.
7) For the purpose of this paragraph, leave-salary does not include a house rent
allowance or other compensatory allowance drawn during leave.
829. In respect of railway servants subject to the Revised State Railway Leave Rules
(February,1930), or the Liberalized Leave Rules(1949), contribution for leave-salary is
recovered from borrowing Departments/Ministries or Governments at the rates
prescribed for foreign service contributions.
The liability of a borrowing Department / Ministry or Government to pay contributions
to the lending Department/Ministry or Government ceases when a railway servant is
permanently transferred to the former but the lending Department/Ministry or
Government remains responsible for the leave-salary in respect of leave earned, both
on average and half average pay, which may be at his credit on the date of his
12

permanent transfer to the borrowing Department/Ministry or Government. The amount
of leave on average pay carried forward should be exhausted first before any leave in
respect of service after permanent transfer to the borrowing Department/Ministry or
Government is taken by him. The debit in respect of leave on half average pay is
accepted only if and when the employee concerned actually consumes such leave.
Note -The above rule applies in the case of candidates transferred from a Railway Office
to a Civil Department or Ministry of the Government of India including Army and Indian
Air Force Head quarters.
830. In respect of Government servants whose services are borrowed by Railways
and who are subject to the Central Government's Revised Leave Rules, 1933 Central
Civil Services (Leave) Rules, 1972, as amended from time to time, or similar rules
issued by other government which make the calculation of leave in relation to the
period of duty impossible, contribution for leave-salary is recovered from Railways. The
liability of Railways to pay contribution to the lending Government ceases when a
Government servant is permanently transferred to the former, but the lending
Government remains responsible for the leave-salary of the Government servants in
respect of "earned leave" at credit on the date of his permanent transfer to Railways.
This amount of "earned leave" should be exhausted first by the Government servant
before any leave in respect of service after permanent transfer to Railways is taken by
him. The leave-salary in respect of any other kind of leave which may be taken by the
Government servant after his permanent transfer to Railways under the railway leave
rules will be borne by railways.
831. There will be no allocation of leave salary with regard to deputations, from the
Railway Audit Offices to Railway departments and vice versa of Government servants
governed by the leave rules in the fundamental rules. Similarly, no contributions for
leave-salary shall be recovered by the lending department for such deputations if the
Government servant concerned is subject to the Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules,
1972.
Note -In respect of transfers of members of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service and
the Indian Railway Accounts Service under the scheme of exchange of officers between
the Indian Audit and Accounts Department and the Indian Railway Accounts
Department, there shall be no allocation of leave- salary/recovery of leave-salary
contributions as between the two Departments.
832. When "Leave not due" is granted to a railway servant while in the service of a
non- Railway Department/Ministry or a State Government the borrowing Department/
13

Ministry or Government sanctioning the leave will bear the charge on account of such
leave in the first instance in all cases, but if the Railway servant on return from such
leave is transferred back to Railways before the "leave not due" taken by him is
completely wiped out, such readjustment of the charge may be made as may be agreed
upon by the two Departments/Ministries or Governments concerned.
833. Leave-salary in respect of Special Disability Leave granted to a railway servant
will be borne by the Railway Administration which sanctioned the leave, provided that
where a railway servant has served under non-Railway Departments/Ministries or State
Governments and is granted Special Disability Leave on average pay under Rule 2122
(7)(b) of the Indian Railway Establishment Code, Volume II, half of which is debitable
to his Leave account under Rule 2118(b) of the Indian Railway Establishment Code,
Volume II, the debit for such leave should be made both in the main and subsidiary
leave accounts and the actual amount of leave-salary drawn by him for the whole
period of such leave will be apportioned among the non-Railway Departments/Ministries
and Governments concerned in the proportion in which that leave is debited to his leave
accounts with those Departments/Ministries and Governments.
834. The leave-salary for the period of Special Disability leave granted to a railway
servant in respect of whom leave-salary contributions are recovered from the borrowing
Government /Department will be borne by that Government/Department under which
the railway servant was serving at the time the disability was incurred even though the
disability manifests itself subsequently.
835. In the case of persons whose leave is regulated by the Fundamental Rules or the
Civil Services Regulations, the liability of the borrowing Government or Department/
Ministry should be taken at 5/22nds of duty in the case of Military Commissioned
Officers and persons subject to the Special Leave Rules and at 2/11th of duty in the
case of others, without regard to the maximum limit of leave that can be earned or
granted under the leave rules to which they are subject.
836. Persons transferred from Company-managed Railways -When an
employee of a company-managed Railway is transferred permanently to an Indian
Railway, the leave-salary in respect of the amount of leave which he may under the
orders of competent authority be permitted to carry forward will, unless the terms of
transfer provide otherwise, be borne by the Company-managed Railway, and no portion
of his leave-salary will be charged to the Indian Railway, until the entire leave brought
forwarded had been exhausted.
14

Note -i) The provisions of this rule will also apply in the case of transfers from the
Indian Railway Conference Association to an Indian Railway, but not vice-
versa.
ii) Not withstanding anything contained in the above paras, from 1st January,
1978 the existing system of allocation or sharing of the liability on account
of leave salary or payment of leave salary contribution by one department
of Central Government to another has been dispensed with. The liability for
leave- salary will be borne in full by the department from which the
Government servant proceeds on leave whether it be his parent department
or a borrowing department with whom he is on deputation. This will apply
to all cases of leave salaries paid on or after that date. In the case of
Government servants who avail of leave on termination of their deputation
period the liability for the leave salary will be borne by the Department
which sanctions the leave.
Incidence Of Pensions
837. Ordinary Pension -Subject to what is provided in paragraphs 839 to 845 below,
the pensionary charges of a railway servant whose service has been exclusively on the
Indian Railways or an office under the administrative control of the Ministry of Railways
(Railway Board) shall be borne by the railway or office where the railway servant last
served immediately before quitting service even if he had no lien on that Railway/office.
Similarly, when a railway servant has also served under a State Government or any
other Ministry of the Central Government, the railway’s share of the pensionary
liabilities will also be borne by the railway/office on which he last served immediately
before quitting service or if he quits service from a non-railway post, immediately
before his transfer to such post.
However, in the case of a railway servant who proceeds on leave preparatory to
retirement or retires or quits service due to some other reason from a post in the
Railway Board's office or a temporary project, the pensionary liability will be borne
either by the Railway Board's office or the Railway Administration, according to where
his lien happens to be on the date of his quitting service.
Note -1) For the purpose of this paragraph, compassionate allowances (see Rule 65 of
Railway Services (Pension) Rules, 1993) are treated as pensions.
2) In the case of a pensionable employee falling under President's decision
below Rule 2405 (C.S.R.362)-Appendix XXX of the Indian Railway
15

Establishment Code, Volume II- the pensionary liability shall be shared
proportionately between the Indian Railways and the Indian Railway
Conference Association on the length of service basis. Similarly, when a
railway servant is transferred to the Indian Railway Conference Association
under the conditions referred to in the aforesaid President's decision and he
quits service from the Indian Railway Conference Association, the
proportionate pensionary liability in respect of Railway service shall be
borne by the Railway Office concerned in terms of the above para.
3) No allocation of pensionary charges is, however, necessary in the following
cases of transfers under the 'Exchange Scheme' -
i) Transfers (between Railway Audit and Railway Department) at the level of
Assistant Audit Officers/members of the subordinate Railway Audit Service.
ii) Transfers of members of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service/Indian
Railway Accounts Service between the Indian Audit and Accounts
Department and the Indian Railway Accounts Department.
838. Calculation of Length of Service -The expression "length of service" used in
the preceding paragraph means "length of qualifying service" as defined under Railway
Services(Pension) Rules, 1993. Except as provided in note (1) below, periods of
probation of training during which the Government servant did not hold a sanctioned
charge, commuted furlough leave on average pay other than the first four months of
each period of such leave, and leave on less than average or full pay and in the case of
Government servants governed by the Central Government's Revised Leave Rules, 1933
Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules, 1972, any period of leave during which leave-salary
was drawn other than earned leave not exceeding 90 days (120 days under the rules as
liberalized in 1949) in any one spell, and special additions (excluding additions in
respect of periods of war service vide paragraph 839) to qualifying service, should be
disregarded in calculating length of service. The effect of omitting these periods will be
that the pensionary liability in respect thereof will be distributed among the employing
Governments in the same proportion as the liability for the rest of the ‘Government
servants' service. The service of a pensioner under any Department/Ministry should be
calculated to the nearest month, 15 days or more being regarded as a month and less
than 15 days being ignored. When the share of pension debitable to a particular
Government comes to less than a rupee, it should be neglected.
Note - 1) In the case of pensions which are earned by total service including leave,
the pensionary liability should subject to these rules, be distributed among
16

the employing Governments or Departments/Ministries in proportion to the
periods for which the Government servant concerned has drawn pay or
leave-salary from each Government or Department/Ministry.
2) Service under a Government includes period for which a Government
servant drew pay or leave-salary from that Government.
3) The periods of leave counting as qualifying service for pension under Rule
2424 (C.S.R. 407) of the Indian Railway Establishment Code, Volume-II
earned under and paid for by a particular Government as shown in the
subsidiary leave account are part and parcel of the qualifying service
rendered under that Government. While calculating the length of qualifying
service, such periods should not be separated from the spells of actual
qualifying duty immediately preceding or following such leave.
4) Foreign service should be treated as service under the Government which
received or remitted, as the case may be, the contributions for pension in
respect of such service.
5) In the case of pensions of Government servants transferred from Burma -to
India before the lst April, 1937 and retiring on or after that date, service
rendered under the Government of Burma before that date should be
ignored for the purposes of this rule. The effect of ignoring such service will
be that the pensionary liability for that service will be distributed among the
other employing Governments in the same proportion as the liability for the
rest of the ‘Government servants’ service. The entire pensionary liability in
cases of such transfers from India to Burma is borne by the Government of
Burma. In the case of transfers on or after the lst April, 1937, liability of the
Government or Governments in India, as the case may be, and of the
Government of Burma will be limited unless settled otherwise by mutual
agreement, to the pension earned by service under each.
6) In respect of pensions sanctioned on or after the 1st April, 1937 for
Government servants who have rendered a part of their service in Aden
prior to its separation-including in their case any service after separation
also-the liability of the Government or Governments in India, as the case
may be, and the Colonial Government should be fixed on the basis of length
of service, any period of service in Aden for which India recovered pension
17

contribution from the Colonial Government in any individual case being
allocated as service in India.
7) Service rendered under the late Crown Representative should be treated as
service under the Central Government (Civil).
839. In the case of railway servants who held higher temporary or officiating posts in
the Defence Services during the Second World War (1939) to whom Article 487-A of the
Civil Service Regulations applies and for whom pension contributions were originally
recovered on the basis of the substantive appointments held by them, the extra
pensionary liability should be debited against the Defence Estimates.
840. Pension for a Deficiency in Service- When a deficiency in qualifying service
is condoned, the period condoned should be reckoned as service under the Government
or Department/Ministry which condones it.
841. Special Pensionary Concessions granted by another Government-
1) When a pension granted by a Department/Ministry or Government under its
own rules is more generous than that admissible under the rules of another
Department/Ministry or Government, the latter Department/Ministry or
Government will bear only the proportionate share which would be
admissible under its own less favourable rules. This principle will come into
operation when there is a divergence in the pension codes of two
Governments, and a pension calculated under the normal working of one
set of rules is more liberal than under the other set of rules. It does not
take into account any concessions which may be allowed under the
discretionary powers contained in the two sets of rules.
2) When a pensionary concession other than the grant of compassionate
allowance or the condonation of a deficiency in qualifying service is granted
by one Department/Ministry or Government, under its own rules
(irrespective of whether or not they are more liberal than the rules of
another Department/Ministry or Government), that Department/Ministry or
Government will bear the resulting increase in pension, unless any portion
of the increased liability has been accepted by the other
Departments/Ministries or Governments affected. In the event of another
Department/Ministry or Government agreeing to the grant of a concession,
the share of the total pension debitable to each Department/Ministry or
18

Government will be determined on the basis of the length of service under
each.
Note -1) In the case of a Government servant who has served partly under the Central
Government and who retires on or after 2nd March, 1938 under the pension rules of
the Government of the Central Provinces and Berar (now Madhya Pradesh) before
completing qualifying service of 30 years and is entitled under these rules to a retiring
pension the Central Government's share of his pension will be calculated according to
the following formula:--
Central Government’s share — A x Y x C
B X
When C = the total pension admissible,
A = the number of years of qualifying service under the Central government,
B = the number of years’ service which the Government servant would have rendered
on attaining the age of 55 years or 30 years’ service, whichever is less,
X = the commutation value at the actual age (next birthday) of retirement, of the
pension admissible (C) expressed as number of years' purchase, and
Y = the commutation value of the pension admissible(C), expressed as umber of years'
purchase at the age (next birthday) of the Government servant (i) at the date on which
he would have completed 30 years' qualifying service or (ii) at the date on which he
attains the of 56 i.e., age next birthday after the age of superannuation (assumed as 55
years for this purpose for all classes of Government servants) whichever would have
come first.
For the purpose of calculating X and Y reference shall be had to the tables prescribed
as Annexure to Appendix XL to the Indian Railway Establishment Code, Volume II.
This formula will apply only to retiring pensions of Government servants if the Central
Government Pension Rules were applicable.
2) In the case of a Government servant in Superior Service who has served partly under
the Central Government and who retires on a retiring pension on or after the 1st April,
1940 under the pension rules of the Government of Sind before completing qualifying
19

service of 30 years, the Central Government's share of his pension will he calculated in
accordance with the formula under Note (1) above.
In the case of such a Government servant who retires on a retiring pension after
completing qualifying service of 30 years or more, the Central Government’s share of
pension will be determined according to Rule 279-A of the Bombay Civil Services Rules.
3) In the case of Government servants governed by the pension rules in the Mumbai
Civil Services Rules the share of pensionary charges of the Central Government for the
period of service rendered under that Government will be calculated under those rules.
842. Pension for Military Service -The principles stated in the preceding two
paragraphs will not apply to military service in respect of any matter in regard to which
special orders exist. No share of the pensionary charges of a railway servant belonging
to the Army in Indian Reserve of Officers for the period he is called out for military
training will be debitable to the Defence Service estimates, the share being debited to
the Government from which the officer drew pay or leave-salary for the period in
question.
843. Wound and Injury Pensions -Extra-ordinary pensions granted for an injury is
chargeable to the Department/Ministry or Government under which the recipient was
serving when the injury was received.
844. Adjustment of Pensionary Charges -
1) When an Adjustment has to be made under these rules between two or more
Governments, it may, except, as provided in sub- paragraph (5) below, be made
either by the payment in lump or in instalments of the commuted value of a
pension or in accordance with any special arrangement which may be concerted
between the Governrnents Governments concerned. The system of lump-sum
adjustments of pensionary charges by payment of commuted value between the
Central Government and State Governments is not, however, to be applied to
pensions which are subject to revision after retirement. In such cases the
adjustments with the Governments concerned should be made as pensions are paid
with reference to the actual amounts paid. In cases where the pensions are divisible
between the Posts and Telegraphs Department and the Railways, the adjustment
will be made on the basis of actual pensions paid.
Note -Pensions divisible between the Central and Tamil Nadu Governments should
be treated as Central or State by recovery of the capitalized value with effect from
20

the 9th February, 1945 The pensions sanctioned between the 22nd October, 1940
and the 9th February, 1945 which have been treated as divisible between the
Central and Tamil Nadu Governments, should be treated as debitable wholly to one
of the Governments by the adjustment of the Capital value, as on the 9th February,
1945, between the two Governments.
2) In adjusting pensionary charges between two or more Governments by payment of
commuted value, the tables of present values prescribed in Appendix XL to the
Indian Railway Establishment Code, Volume II, should be employed unless the
Governments concerned mutually agree to employ any other table.
3) The Defence Department's share of a divisible pension should in all cases, excepting
those falling under sub- paragraph (5) below, be extinguished by credit of the
commuted value of that share to Central (Civil) by debit to Defence, the adjustment
being made as and when each case arises. This procedure will have the effect of
converting the Defence Department's share of the divisible pension into one relating
to Central (Civil) for all purposes and will not in any way effect the arrangements
that may be agreed upon for the adjustment of pensions between the Central and
State Governments.
4) The provisions contained in the preceding sub-paragraph will be applied conversely
for the settlement of the civil shares of military pensions which are not subject to
revision after retirement. That is to say, the Civil share of a divisible pension
debitable to a state or to the Central Government (Civil) will be extinguished by
credit of the commuted value of that share to Defence by debit to Central (Civil),
the adjustment being made as and when each case arises. The Defence Accounts
Officer will report periodically to the State Accountant General the amount of
pensions paid in respect of cases where the arrangement between the Central and
State Governments concerned for the adjustment of pensions is with reference to
actual payments. This report should also cover cases where a pension which has
been adjusted as provided in this rule is subsequently transferred for payment in
the United Kingdom.
5) The system of adjustment between Governments or Departments/Ministries by
payment of commuted value does not apply to pensions payable in England.
845. Commuted Pensions -When a portion of a pension which is debitable to more
than one Government is commuted by payment of the capitalized value of a portion to
21

the pensioner, the amount commuted may be taken as being in absorption or reduction
of the shares debitable to the different Governments in the order in which those shares
rise from the least to the largest amount, except in the case of pensions paid by the
Commonwealth Relations Officer, London, where the amount commuted is taken first in
absorption or reduction of the share debitable to Defence estimates.
Thus, if, out of a pension of Rs. 400 per month which is apportioned as follows:-
Government A Rs. 80.
Government B Rs. 100.
Government C Rs. 220.
Rs. 100 is commuted, the commutation will have the effect of extinguishing the shares
of Rs. 80 debitable to Government A and reducing from Rs. 100 to Rs. 80 the share
debitable to Government B.
The capitalized value of the amount commuted should, in such a case, be debited to
Governments A and B in proportion to the amounts by which their monthly shares of
the pension have been reduced.
In respect of pensions which are divisible between the Central Government and a State
Government, the Central Government may authorize the debit to Central Revenues of
the whole commuted value of a portion of the pension not exceeding the commuted
value of the share of the pension debitable to it, if the State Government concerned
cannot find funds to meet the payment of its share of commuted value.
Note -Not withstanding anything contained in the above paras, from Ist January, 1978
the liability for pension including gratuity will be borne in full by the department to
which the Government servant permanently belongs at the time of retirement. No
recovery of proportionate pension need be Made from other Central Government
Departments under whom he had served. This will apply to all pensions sanctioned on
or after that date.
Incidence Of Gratuity And Contribution To Provident Fund
846. Gratuity and special contribution to Provident Fund -The gratuity of a
railway servant exclusively employed in the Ministry of Railways, attached offices of the
Ministry of Railways, Zonal Railways, Production Units and other offices subordinate to
the Ministry of Railways, will be charged to the office where he held a lien at the time of
22

retirement or death provided that in the case of an officer confirmed as General
Manager of an Indian Railway, the Railway from which the officer retired or proceeded
on leave preparatory to retirement will accept the debit.
Note -The term 'Gratuity' used in this section includes also special contribution to the
Provident Fund.
847. In the case of a Railway servant transferred to and from, the Indian Railway
Conference Association, the gratuity shall be apportioned on the basis of the length of
service under the Indian Railway Conference Association and the Railway Administration
provided such apportionment has been mutually agreed upon.
848. For the purposes of the preceding two paragraphs, the service rendered by a
railway servant under the foreign employer, a State Government or another
Department/ Ministry of the Central Government or on a Construction or survey will be
deemed to be service rendered on the Railway which received the contribution towards
gratuity in respect of such employment.
849. When a person who is permanently transferred from Railways is admitted under
proper sanction to the contributory (Transferred Railway Personnel) Provident Fund
Rules, the Special Contribution or Gratuity admissible will be paid by the
Department/Ministry which last employed him and apportioned between Railways and
the other Department/Ministry on the basis of the length of service. The non-railway
portion of the charge is accounted for under the appropriate head relating to the
Department /Ministry concerned.
In the case of temporary transfers the question of apportionment of Special
Contribution or Gratuity does not arise, vide paragraphs 852-854.
Note -The provisions of this paragraph do not apply in the case of persons transferred
to the organisation of the Commissioner of Railway Safety under ministry of Civil
Aviation in whose case annual contribution for special contribution to provident
fund/gratuity is paid by the Railways and the entire charge is borne by that Ministry.
850. Contribution to Provident Fund -The Government contribution made to the
State Railway Provident Fund account of a railway servant is charged to the railway to
which his pay was charged for the half-year to which the contribution relates.
851. When a railway servant is transferred to another railway or accounts circle during
the course of a half-year, his account should be credited with the amount of
23

Government contribution at the prescribed rate, before transferring the account.
852. Except as provided in Rules 853 and 854 contributions in respect of Provident
Fund of a Railway servant in foreign service or in another Government Department/
Ministry or State Government will be payable by the foreign employer, another
Department/Ministry or State Government concerned, or by the railway servant himself,
as the case may be, at the rate of 1/8th of the total of the emoluments drawn by the
railway servant from time to time plus the contribution payable or that would have been
otherwise payable on account of leave-salary.
Note -The above contribution will not be recovered during leave taken by the railway
servant while in service under the foreign employer, etc.
853. The contributions that will be recoverable in respect of a subscriber lent to a
construction or survey or to a large open line work to fill a post especially created for
the construction or supervision of the work, shall be recovered at the rate of 1/8th of
the emoluments only, drawn by or admissible to him from time to time unless the
account of the subscriber has been transferred to the new organization, in which case
the recovery shall be limited to 1/24 th of the emoluments.
854. In the case of candidates transferred from a Railway Administration to a Civil
Department or Ministry of the Government of India including Army and Indian Air Force
Headquarters, the Payment of contributions will be suspended during the period of
probation though the railway servant concerned will continue to subscribe to the State
Railway Provident Fund. If the Railway servant is confirmed in the new post, no
contribution will be paid by the Civil or Military Department/Ministry for the period of
probation and it will be for that Department/Ministry to determine what part of the
service of the railway servant prior to such confirmation will count for pension. If the
railway servant is not so confirmed and is reverted to the Railway Administration,
contribution with interest thereon will be paid by the Civil or Military
Department/Ministry retrospectively in respect of the period of probation as though the
railway servant had been lent to that Department/Ministry for the period in question.
Provided that- (i) In cases where, instead of contribution for leave-salary, the incidence
of cost of leave-salary is regulated by paragraph 828, the contribution shall be
recovered at 1/8th of the total of the emoluments drawn from time to time plus
contribution that would have been otherwise payable on account of leave-salary.
(ii) In the case of candidates transferred from a Railway Administration to a Civil
Department or Ministry of the Government of India including Army and Indian Air Force
24

Headquarters, the payment of contributions will be suspended during the period of
probation though the railway servant concerned will continue to subscribe to the State
Railway Provident Fund. If the railway servant is confirmed in the new post, no
contribution will be paid by the Civil or Military Department/Ministry for the period of
probation and it will be for that Department/Ministry to determine what part of the
service of the railway servant prior to such confirmation will count for pension. If the
railway servant is not so confirmed and is reverted to the Railway Administration,
contributions with interest thereon will be paid by the Civil or Military
Department/Ministry retrospectively in respect of the period of probation as though the
railway servant had been lent to that Department/Ministry for the period in question.
855. The Government contribution in respect of open line staff employed on a
construction or survey is chargeable to the construction or survey concerned.
Note -Notwithstanding anything contained in the above paras, from 1st January, 1978
the liability on Government Contribution will be borne by the parent department and no
share of contribution will be recovered from any borrowing department of the Central
Government with effect from that date.
Incidence Of The Cost Of Railway Police
856. With effect from 1st April, 1979, the cost of GRP (without distinction of 'Crime'
and 'Order Police') will be shared between the State Government and Railways on 50:50
basis, provided that the strength of GRP is determined with the approval of the
Railways.
(Authority Railway Board's letter no.92/Sec(CA)/50/4 dated 21.07.1993)—acs no.29
857. For the purpose of calculating Railway's share of cost of GRP the following will be
included :-
i) Pay and all types of allowances in respect of GRP staff including office and
supervisory staff up to the level of Inspector General of Police provided they
are exclusively in-charge of GRP.
ii) Office expenses and contingencies.
iii) Cost of pensionery charges.
iv) Cost of rent of building occupied by GRP staff.
(Authority Railway Board's letter no.92/Sec(CA)/50/4 dated 21.07.1993) acs
no.30
858. In addition to above, charges on account of medical reimbursement and medical
allowances payable to staff, may also be considered in internal check for payment.
25

However, charges on account of Pay and allowances of medical staff viz. Doctors,
Nurses etc. are not to be shared.
(Authority Railway Board's letter no.92/Sec(CA)/50/4 dated 21.07.1993) acs no.31
859. Protection of Railway Bridges under normal condition is the responsibility of the
concerned State Governments and the expenditure incurred thereon will be borne by
them.
(Authority Railway Board's letter no.92/Sec(CA)/50/4 dated 21.07.1993) acs no.32
860. When the services of the Military or other armed forces of the union are placed at
the disposal of the Railways at the request of the Railway Administration, the
expenditure of the guards will fall upon the Railway.
(Authority Railway Board's letter no.92/Sec(CA)/50/4 dated 21.07.1993) acs no.33
861. If the substitution is made on general ground of Government Policy and service is
taken over by Defence Services, or other Public Service Department as part of the
regular duties, the charges will be debited to Defence Services or the Public Department
concerned as the case may be.
(Authority Railway Board's letter no.92/Sec(CA)/50/4 dated 21.07.1993) acs no.34
862. The debits will be based on yearly actual expenditure and the total liabilities for
any one year will be payable by the railway during that year.
(Authority Railway Board's letter no.92/Sec(CA)/50/4 dated 21.07.1993) acs no.35
863. For convenience of accounting however, the recoveries for the first three
quarters of a year will be made on the basis of the budget estimates of the State
concerned and those for the fourth quarter, which are adjusted in the accounts for
March, will be based on the revised estimate of the year of the State concerned and will
include any adjustment which might be necessary in respect of the previous three
quarters on account of the difference between budget and revised estimate figures, so
that the total recovery for the four quarters will be equal to amount provided in the
revised estimates. Any difference between the revised estimate and actuals for the year
will be adjusted in the following year.
(Authority Railway Board's letter no.92/Sec(CA)/50/4 dated 21.07.1993) acs no.36
864. The debits raised by State Governments shall be supported by statements of
actual expenditure which should be checked by the Accounts Officer, as far as possible,
before acceptance. The number of staff for which debits are raised should be
scrutinized with reference to the number of police actually employed on railway
premises. The Principal Chief Security Commissioner and Financial Adviser and Chief
Accounts Officer shall maintain registers showing the strength accepted and variations
26

there to made from time to time to prevent excessive or wrong debits being accepted
by the Railway Administration. The other items in respect of which debits are raised
should be adjusted to whatever checks as are possible.
(Authority Railway Board's letter no.92/Sec(CA)/50/4 dated 21.07.1993) acs no.37
865. Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs 862 to 864 above, recoveries may
also be made on the basis of a fixed annual lump sum figures as may be agreed upon
between the State Governments and the Railway Administration(s) concerned. This
annual lump sum figure will be fixed for the period of three or five years and will be
based on the basis of average cost of Government Railway Police depending on the
actual number of staff agreed to.
In the case of any increase in the strength of police or any substantial changes in the
scales of pay or allowance, etc. during the currency of the period for which the lump
sum figure is fixed, the lump sum figure already fixed will remain unchanged but the
question of a supplementary payment for the additional cost might be considered on
the specific request of the State Government concerned. This increase will, however, be
taken in to account for the purpose of fixation of the lump sum figure in the next
triennium or quinquennium.
(Authority Railway Board's letter no.92/Sec(CA)/50/4 dated 21.07.1993) acs no.38
866. Bills for the cost of Railway police employed on each railway will be sent by State
Governments direct to the Railway Administration concerned.
(Authority Railway Board's letter no.92/Sec(CA)/50/4 dated 21.07.1993) acs no.39
Other Inter Railway Adjustments
867. Inter Railway adjustments will be made in respect of the following.-
a) through traffic earnings,
b) transfer of deposits or recoveries from staff or out-siders,
c) receipts or issues from stores and manufacturing suspense, and
d) expenditure incurred on repairs or manufacture of rolling stock by
one railway for another.
868. Apportionment of Earnings -
A) Through Traffic -The apportionment of earnings in respect of through traffic
should be made as indicated below :-
27

i) The Zonal Railways performing the terminal and transhipment operations
should, in the first instance, be credited with the amount calculated at the
following rates :-
Transhipment operations- at the public traffic rates for transhipment charges,
and Terminal operations- at the rates adopted for payments to Port Railways
from time-to-time.
ii) The residual freight earnings should be apportioned amongst the individual
Zonal Railways on distance basis.
B) Diverted Goods Traffic -The through earnings should be apportioned as indicated
below:-
i) Credit the Railways which actually perform the terminal operation and/or
transhipment operation at the rates of terminal/transhipment charges
applicable to public traffic.
ii) The residual earnings, after giving due allowance for terminal/transhipment
operation as indicated in (i) above, should be apportioned amongst the Zonal
Railways on the basis of kilometres by the carried route.
Where diversions are of a permanent nature and consist of definite identifiable streams
of traffic, adjustments should be made so that the financial position of the Railways
concerned is correctly presented. It is also essential that meticulous calculations
involving time and labour should be avoided and broad estimates should be made by
taking representative samples.
869. Working Expenses -
1) Provision of' Engines -Debits will be passed on by the owning Railway to the
using Railway at the unit cost based on the total engine hour on outage basis (i.e. from
the time it leaves from the shed & till it returns to the shed) earned by the engines on
the using Railway. It should be ensured that the constituent elements of the debit viz.,
repairs and maintenance, and depreciation charges are not lumped together and shown
under ordinary working expenses. These elements should be exhibited under the
relevant heads and grants.
(Authority Ministry of Railway (Railway Board)’s letter No. F(C)/2004/27/1 dated
30.09.04)-acs no.61
28

2) Fuel Consumption - For adjustments on account of fuel consumption (diesel oil
and coal), credit or debit should be afforded for the work done by the Railway on behalf
of the other Railway systems. Adjustments should be made on the basis of rate of
consumption per 1000 G.T. Kms. This rate should be as realistic as possible taking the
specific trip/shed/divisional rate of consumption. Recourse to sampling should be made
only in cases of heavy gradients or significant changes in loads, etc., where the
shed/divisional averages may not reflect the position correctly.
3) Wagon Hire charges -The per diem wagons hire charges are made up of the
elements of repairs and Maintenance, and depreciation charges. The debits or credits
should be shown separately under the relevant heads and grants i.e., the element
pertaining to repairs and maintenance, and depreciation charges should be shown
under the appropriate head of account and grant.
4) Hire of passenger coaches -The credit/debit adjustments should be worked out
on the basis of kilometres earned by through rakes/passenger coaches running on more
than one railway system. Vehicle kilometres in respect of through coaches should be
worked out on the basis of the working time table periods and the rake links. As in the
case of wagon hire, hire of Passenger coaches should have three distinct constituent
elements, viz., Repairs, maintenance and Depreciation charges. Unit cost should be
worked out by the Zonal Railways separately for each of these constituent elements per
vehicle kilometre and the individual rates should be applied.
870. Miscellaneous -In respect of all other items of work done or service rendered
by one railway on behalf of other railways or facilities provided by one Railway for other
Railways which do not fall in the above categories, credits or debits should be worked
out by the owning/serving Zonal Railways and raised against the using Railways if the
annual cost (depreciation and working expenses) of individual operation or facilities is
more than Rs. One Crore to that Railway. The cost of facilities and operation at joint
stations if more than Rs. One Crore (for which credit, debit has not been afforded
through the apportionment of earnings) should also be similarly distributed between the
owning and using Railways on a 'reasonable basis' in consultation with their respective
Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer.
Similarly where any moneys are received by a Railway, which are attributable to
services provided by the other Railways also, e.g. income from bulk advertisement
contracts, the share attributable to each Railway will be credited to that Railway if the
total income is in excess of Rs. One Crore.
29

Explanation of 'reasonable basis: The parameters to be used for apportionment and the
documents for extracting the figures are given below:-
i) The apportionment of the operation and maintenance cost may be worked out
at the beginning of the financial year after every three years. The
apportionment study so done may be kept valid for three years. For
successive years (for 2nd and 3 rd year) the cost of apportionment may be
escalated by 10% over the cost arrived for the preceding year. The first such
study may be done for the year 2009-10 and next study would be due in
2012-13. The apportionment may be done for each year. For efficient
apportionment the process may be computerised.
ii) The apportionment of various costs may be done on the basis of the ratios
based upon the various documents mentioned against each item as detailed
in Annexure "A" of Railway Board’s letter No.2007/F(C)/Misc/27/l dated 31-
07-09. The documents used for apportioning the cost may be made available
by the owning Railway to the adjoining Railway on demand by the latter.
iii) The earnings accruing from the Joint Stations (which have not been accounted
for in the station (which have not been accounted for in the station balance
sheets of the Railways but which have been accounted for as earnings by the
owning Railway) need to be subtracted from the apportioned cost to arrive at
the net amount to be debited to the using Railway. These earnings should be
distributed between the Railways in the ratio of the originating passengers.
The various sources of earnings which should be taken into consideration are
mentioned in Annexure "B" of Railway Board letter No.2007/F(C)/Misc/27/l
dated 31/07/2009. This will come into force with effect from 01-04-2009.
(Authority Ministry of Railways (Railway Board's) letter No.2007/F(C) 27/l dated
31/07/2009. )-ACS NO.68
Note -No inter-railway financial adjustment need be made in respect of
interest/dividend charges as referred to in paras 869 and 870 above. Nevertheless the
effect of this element may be assessed and the net amount thereof at the end of the
year exhibited as a foot note in the statement showing calculations of dividend on loan
capital payable to General Revenues so that this amount can duly be taken into account
in arriving at the amount of dividend to be exhibited proforma in the Profit and Loss
accounts of the various Zonal railways.

CHAPTER VII
Allocation Of Expenditure
701. General Principles of Allocation -'Allocation' of expenditure implies
identifying its source of Finance and should be distinguished from 'classification'
which deals with the detailed heads of account under which expenditure is recorded
in the accounting books of the Railway. Railway expenditure is financed from Capital
provided by the General Revenues, Railway Funds, Extra Budgetary Resources
(Institutional Finance) (EBR/IF), EBR (IRFC-Bonds) and Extra Budgetary Resources
(Partnership) (EBR/P) and Current Revenues. Accordingly, the expenditure is
allocated to (i) Capital, (ii) the Depreciation Reserve Fund (iii) the Development
Fund, (iv) EBR/IF (v) EBR(IRFC-Bonds), (vii) EBR/P (viii) Railway safety Funds (ix)
other specific fund and (x) Revenue. The detailed classification of (a) the
expenditure chargeable to Revenue is given in Appendix I, and of (b) Capital and
other Works Expenditure is given in Appendix II. The classification of revenue is
given in Appendix III. {Appendices I to III are printed as a separate volume vide
Financial Code Volume II). The List of Major and Minor Heads of Accounts of Railway
Revenue, Capital, Debt and Remittance Transactions adjusted in Railway Books are,
however, given in Appendix IV of Indian Railway Code for the Accounts Department.
Appendices I to III referred to in para 701 are in replacement of Appendices I to III
of General Code Vol. II.
702. The general principles on which railway expenditure should be allocated
between the sources of finance mentioned in the preceding paragraph are described
in paras 703 to 715 below. These principles are based on the recommendations of
the Railway Convention Committee, 1949, as amended from time to time.
703. Capital bears -
1) the cost of land as defined in paragraph 717 except in cases provided in
paragraphs 718 and 719 ;
2) the first cost of constructions and equipment of (i) new lines including
strategic lines, whether remunerative or unremunerative and (ii) new
production units;
3) the cost of maintaining a section of the line not opened for working;
4) the cost of any additions to the line or equipment of the line, when it is
not chargeable to Development Fund;
5) the cost of any additional plant and machinery not connected with any
specific work; and
6) the cost of any tools and plant specifically purchased, and of any posts
specially created for the supervision or construction of a work, in
2

accordance with the provisions of paragraph 776.
7) the capital component of IRFC lease charges.
(Note -Provided that the capital component of IRFC lease charge shall be
charged to Capital, if adequate funds are not available under Capital
Fund. However, the above payment shall be the first charge on Capital
Fund if sufficient funds are available.)

should be allocated according to the normal ruler as if it were a
new work
ii) When an item of rolling stock is replaced by another of less

tractive power, seating capacity or floor area or carrying capacity
as the case may be, the new asset cannot be held to render fully
the services for which the old asset was intended and to the
extent to which the new stock falls short of the requirement in this
respect, the old stock should be considered to have been
abandoned, and the credit for the proportion of the original cost
thereof afforded to Capital.

2) the cost at debit of Capital Fund of an asset which is abandoned or disposed
of without being replaced;
Note -
i) When such an asset is subsequently replaced, the adjustment made
under these rules shall be reversed provided the cost of replacement is

adjustment should not be made, but the cost of replacement should be
allocated according to the normal rules as if it were a new work.
ii) When an item of rolling stock purchased from Capital Fund is replaced
by another of less tractive power, seating capacity or floor area or
carrying capacity as the case may be, the new asset cannot be held to
render fully the services for which the old asset was intended and to
the extent to which the new stock falls short of the requirement in this
respect, the old stock should be considered to have been abandoned,
and the credit for the proportion of the original cost thereof afforded to
Capital Fund.

715 C. Extra Budgetary Resources (EBR)
EBR(P): Cost sharing with State Government for Plan Heads New Lines, Traffic
Facilities, Road Safety Works, Other Electrical Works (incl TRD) and Customer
Amenities-
Another component of EBR is EBR-Partnership which captures the investments made
by third parties on the railway network and includes sidings, private freight
terminals, contributions of state governments in joint venture projects, loans directly
provided to Railway companies for which IR stands as guarantor, etc.
EBR (IF): A new source of fund was introduced in the Railway Budget 2015-16 for
financing projects. The funds are borrowed from institutional sources so as to ensure
availability for completion of projects critical for the Railways for generation of
revenues.EBR(IF) allocations would be utilized for priority works under Plan Heads New
11

Lines, Gauge Conversion, Doubling, Traffic Facilities, Railway Electrification, S&T etc with a
view to enhancing throughput on the congested corridors.
EBR (IRFC-Bonds): Allocation of Business Rules of GOI allow only MOF to borrow
funds for GOI finances. For supplementing funds to finance Railway Budget, the
finance arm of Indian Railways, i.e. Indian Railway Finance Corporation does the
borrowings. These funds are utilized primarily for procurement of rolling stock,
which is then leased to IR for a fixed period. IR pays lease charges to IRFC - both
principal and interest components. After the lease period the assets are handed
over to Railways at an agreeable amount.

Electrical Works, Machinery and Plant, Workshops, Passenger Amenities and
Training/HRD.
716. The following detailed rules regulate the allocation of expenditure in particular
cases and are intended to be illustrative of the application of the basic principles in
practice.
717. Land -Land taken up permanently, whether for works or Revenue purposes
of the railway is charged irrespective of cost to Capital All charges incidental to the
acquisition of land are included in the cost of land.
Note -Incidental charges are defined in the "Explanatory Note 1120" against'
Land' in Appendix II of Volume II of this code.
718. The cost of land provided free to subsidized railways is debited to the minor
head “Subsidized Companies" under major head 345-Indian Railways Policy
Formulation, Direction, Research and other Miscellaneous Organisations. No
readjustment to capital is allowed after such a railway is purchased by Government.
719. The cost of land required for the acquisition of materials by quarrying, mining,
boring, or other operation; and payments for royalty, mining rights, etc., connected
with the same, is dealt with as part of the cost of the manufacturing operations or
charged off finally to the work concerned.
720. Rent or other miscellaneous charges in connection with the hire of land,(e.g.,
the compensation payable for land acquired temporarily under Section 35 of the
Land Acquisition Act of 1894) are charged to the work concerned.
12

721. The cost of filling up burrow pits as a conservancy measure is chargeable to
Revenue. When the filling up of borrow pits is necessitated by the construction of a
new work, the cost of filling up should be allocated to the work concerned.
722. When land, originally acquired at the cost of capital, is sold or surrendered,
the sale proceeds are in all cases credited to Capital.
723. When land is lost through erosion, its cost is written back from Capital to
Revenue. If the land so washed away subsequently reforms and is used by the
Railway, the adjustment originally made between Capital and Revenue is reversed.
724. Surveys & Preconstruction activities -The expenditure incurred on a
survey or pre-construction activity is in the first instance charged to the head
“3001-A Indian Railways Policy Formulation, Direction Research and other
Miscellaneous Organizations (Miscellaneous Expenditure General)" and when the
construction of the project is Sanctioned by the competent authority, it is
transferred to the project concerned, irrespective of the year in which the
expenditure was originally incurred.
Note -If the adjustment of such expenditure involves large amounts, it may be
considered specially in consultation with Audit.
Railway Board Authority 2024/F(X)II/10/15 dated 11.07.2024 (ACS No 03)
725. New lines -The allocation of expenditure on new lines after the date of
opening, but before the closing of the completion estimate, is regulated by the
rules in paragraphs 726 to 732.
726. The cost of completing works which were incomplete on the date of opening
and of works which, though commenced after that date may properly be considered
as forming essential parts of first equipment, is charged to Capital.
727. During the period for which such works remain incomplete, the cost of their
maintenance, replacement or renewal is also charged to Capital, provided the
maintenance, replacement or renewal becomes necessary directly out of their
incomplete state.
728. The cost of maintenance of works which were complete on the date of
opening is charged to Revenue. The cost of their replacement or renewal is allocated
to Depreciation Reserve Fund according to the provisions of paragraph 754 et c.
For the purpose of this rule a work is considered to be "complete" only when, for the
first time, it conforms in all respects to its accepted specification.
13

729. A few instances are given below to elucidate further the principles enunciated
in paragraphs 726 to 728.
730. Cess repairs and earthwork for banks undertaken immediately after the
opening of a line, while the construction estimate is still open may be regarded as
works necessary to complete the bank, chargeable to Construction Estimate and
debitable to Capital.
731. Ballast and permanent way are regarded as "complete" when they are laid to
the accepted specification and any subsequent packing or other work that becomes
necessary after opening of the line should he charged to Revenue.
732. Repairs to bridge bed blocks, training works, protective works, mile-stones,
engine sheds, water columns and quarters which have been completed to
specification, and are capable of being put to the use for which they were intended,
are chargeable to Revenue irrespective of whether they were actually so used or
not. If works were not complete as defined above, the cost of repair is chargeable to
Capital.
733. Lines partially opened for traffic- Subject to the provisions of Rule 727 in
regard to the maintenance of incomplete works, the maintenance charges of a line,
or a portion of a line which has been opened for traffic but the maintenance of
which continues to be supervised by construction staff should be allocated as
follows. Such of the charges as can be identified as directly allocable to the line or
portion of the line opened for traffic should be debited to Revenue. The cost of
supervising and miscellaneous staff and other miscellaneous expenditure, which is
not so identifiable, should be distributed between Capital and Revenue in the ratio
which the total Capital expenditure, both on opened and unopened portion of the
line, bears to Revenue expenditure on the portion opened to traffic plus Revenue
earnings of that portion. So for as the maintenance of permanent way is concerned,
the debit to Revenue in respect of expenditure not so identifiable, may be arrived at
on an estimated basis having regard to the expenditure on the maintenance of a line
similarly located.
Note -The term 'Capital expenditure' in this Paragraph means 'gross' expenditure,
ignoring any credits for the value of released materials.

(b) when there is an increase in the depth of ballast for the purpose of maintaining
the requisite depth;
Note -Cost of ballasting an unballasted line within three years of its opening will
follow the allocation of the original construction estimate.
ii) to Depreciation Reserve Fund when there is an improvement in the type of
ballast (e.g. when sand or moorum ballast is replaced by stone ballast) or when
the depth of ballast is increased beyond the normal prescribed depth to comply
with the revised track standards.
If the additions or improvements are so connected with the relaying etc, the
supply of additional or improved ballast should form an integral part of the
operation of and be combined with the “ Permanent Way” portion of the estimate
for relaying and replacement for the purpose of allocation.
Note -1) the word “Improvements” occurring in this sub-Paragraph includes
“renewals”
2) the expression "connected with the relaying" should be taken to mean strictly
only where ballasting is a necessary and integral part of relaying, but when relaying
is taken as an occasion to simultaneously add to the ballast, it should not be held
that the ballasting is connected with the relaying.
740. Temporary and Experimental Works- The cost of a temporary or
15

experimental work is chargeable to Revenue. When, however, it ceases to be
temporary or experimental and becomes permanent, or is replaced by a permanent
work, the actual cost of the work should be transferred to the debit of fund in works.
741. Maintenance of Quarters for Construction Staff- When quarters built as
part of important open line works in progress and not handed over to be managed
by the open line, are occupied by the open line staff, the rent realized shall be
credited and the cost of repairs and maintenance debited to revenue. But when such
quarters or occupied by construction staff, the rent will be credited to, and the cost
of repairs and maintenance of such quarters even if vacant should be debited to, the
project.
742. Rolling Stock- All first equipment of rolling stock for a line of railway is
chargeable to Capital/EBR (IRFC-Bond). Whether an item of rolling stock provided
otherwise than as first equipment is to be accounted for as an addition or as a
replacement or renewal shall be decided according to the following principles.
743. Renewals must always take precedence of “ Additions”
744. When additions are made to the Rolling Stock of any class authorised for the
Railway, the cost of such additions should be charged to Capital. However, as an
exception to this, the cost of new coaches procured to make good the loss in the
seating capacity of replaced coaches due to the provision of additional facilities for
the passengers in the new coaches (though they are treated as additions to the
authorised stock for the Railway) should be charged to the Development Fund in
accordance with item 7 of List “A” below Note (2) under para 711.
745. No new rolling stock should be charged to Capital as additions, if the actual
stock of that class in existence on the line is below the authorized stock for the
railway, when additions to rolling stock are made under classes in respect of which
there has previously been a reduction in authorized stock, the new stock should be
considered to have replaced the stock previously reduced.
746. The following are the classes into which rolling stock is divided for the
purposes of the preceding paragraph, but if there is any doubt whether a
particular item belongs to one class or another, the decision of the Railway Board
should be obtained-
Class Particulars
1) Locomotives, diesel and battery.
2) Locomotives, electric.
3) Coaching stock ( suburban motor units).
16

4) Coaching stock, self-propelled and trailers.
5) Saloons.
6) Tourist cars and Restaurant cars.
7) Coaching stock, upper classes, including all vehicles in which air-
conditioned or first class accommodation is provided.
8) Coaching stock, including brake, luggage and postal in which
second class accommodation is provided.
9) Other coaching vehicles, including brake, luggage, postal, motor,
fruit, fish, poultry, duck (vans) and horse-boxes, in which no
passenger accommodation is provided.
10) Officers carriages
11) Service coaching vehicles, including stores vans, tool vans, break
down vans and subordinate inspection carriages.
12) General service goods wagons, including open, covered, low sided
rail and timber
trucks.
13) Acid, oil and petrol tank wagons.
14) Other goods vehicles, including cattle wagons and explosive wagons.
15) Well wagons.
16) Goods brake-vans.
17) Service wagons, including ballast hopper, crane support, crane and
weigh bridge testing wagons, and water tank wagons.
18) Mineral centre discharge hopper wagons.
Note -The above represent the maximum number of classes. A similar number of
classes may be observed, when deciding whether an item of new rolling stock is to
be treated as an addition or a replacement. Within each such class, the particular
item of rolling stock which should be considered as being replaced is that which
approximates most closely to the vehicle that is being provided on renewal account.
Where close approximation is impracticable or where difficulty arises in determining
what is the stock most closely approximating, due regard should be paid to the
consideration of eliminating any debit to capital that can be avoided consistently
with the adequacy of the replacement.
747. The classification given in the preceding paragraph is intended to cover
ordinary cases where new stock of particular class is obtained, but when new stock
of a particular class supersedes actually old stock of another class, the case should
be referred to the Railway Board for orders on its individual merits.
748. Railway administration shall maintain in the necessary detail, statistics of
Rolling Stock showing the figures separately for each class of rolling stock, the
numbers of the gross authorized stock, the reduction therein made from time to
17

time and the net authorized stock.
749. Stand bys -For the purpose of this rule a "stand-by" is a complete unit of
machinery, plant or equipment which is kept in order to perform the functions of the
main unit of machinery, plant or equipment to which it is a "stand-by" and with
which it may be identifiable, when such unit is put out of action temporarily on
account of accident or periodical repairs, or is required to assist when the main unit
has to meet on overload. The cost of such "stand-by" is chargeable to the head to
which the machinery, plant or equipment to which it is a "stand-by" is charged. A
"stand-by" does not include articles which have been replaced but continue to give
service as unauthorized stock or duplicates for some time after.
750. Spares -Other spare items of machinery, plant or equipment, whether
complete units or parts, which do not fulfil the conditions of the preceding
paragraph, such as boiler tubes, super heater element, armatures, valves, coils,
etc., will be called "spares" for the purpose of rule. The cost of such "spares"
should, in all cases be brought on to the Stores Suspense Account and charged to
revenue when handed over to be retained in the custody or issued to the using
department. Exceptional cases where a debit to capital is considered justifiable
should be referred to the Railway Board for orders. The following items have been
admitted by the Railway Board as justifying a charge to capital provided they cost
individually more than the monetary limit prescribed from time to time.
a) spare boilers for each type of locomotive in use, up to 7 percent of their
total authorised stock of locomotives, intended to accelerate engine repairs,
b) spare boilers for watering arrangements at stations and power-operated spare
pumping sets; and
c) the items of spares of circulatory nature for Diesel Locos /Rail Cars listed below
when costing the monetary limit prescribed from time to time or more per loco
set/rail car should be charged to capital.
List of spares for Diesel Locos / Diesel Rail Cars to be charged to Capital.

751.
752A. Spare C & W bogies built with wheels and axles provided to facilitate and
expedite the out turn of coaches and wagons from the repair shops, has been
admitted by the Railway Board as justifying a charge to Capital provided they cost
individually more than the monetary limit prescribed from time to time and held in
shops/sheds as non-stock items with complete documentation.
753. Replacement and Renewals--.After the date of opening of a line for traffic,
the cost of replacement or renewal of works or articles of equipment which were
complete on that date, is allocated in accordance with the rules in paragraphs 754 to
758.
754. Except as provided in paragraphs 703 (5) and 711 (2), the full cost of
replacement, including the improvement and inflationary elements, of an asset
should be charged to the Depreciation Reserve Fund.
19

755. When the cost of replacement is chargeable to the Depreciation Reserve Fund
and is less than the original cost (cost at the debit of Capital or Development Fund
etc) of the assets replaced, which may be estimated if not known, the entire cost of
replacement should be charged to the Depreciation Reserve Fund and difference
between the original and the cost of replacement should be credited to Capital or
Development Fund etc as the case may be, by debit to the Depreciation Reserve
Fund.
756. Deleted.
757. If the original cost of an asset was partly debited to the Development Fund
and partly to Open Line Works-Revenue, the cost of replacement of such an asset
shall be allocated to the Depreciation Reserve Fund.
758. For the purpose of paragraphs 754 and 755, a replacement or renewal to
admit of a debit to the Depreciation Reserve Fund must fall under one of the
fo1lowing categories.-
1) Renewals, including casual renewals of rails, sleepers and fastenings, such
as fish plates, fish-bolts, spikes, points and crossings, tongue rails;
2) wholesale renewals or strengthening of bridges and girders;
3) renewals of assets detailed in paragraphs 759 to 768 and
4) Renewals of all assets except those detailed in the list appended below:
a) Train lighting equipment including dynamos, batteries and re-wiring
(Electric equipment).
b) Locomotive fire-boxes.

j) Stair cases and side-walks of bridges.
k) Ballast.
l) Re-wiring of high tension circuits of motor coaches of suburban electric
rolling stock.
m) Flexible pinion assembly on the Electric Freight Locomotives.
20

When a renewal or replacement does not fall under any of the categories detailed in
this rule, the cost of replacement will be borne by Revenue
Note - The cost of repairing flood damages, including the cost of repairing damages
to track caused by accidents, is chargeable to " Revenue, Maintenance and Repairs",
unless the repairs are associated with an element of betterment when the cost
should be charged to the Depreciation Reserve Fund.
759. Renewals of rails, etc.-When renewal of track is proposed by different
weight of rail and different type of Sleeper, the amount chargeable to the
Depreciation Reserve Fund will either be the estimated original cost of the material
in the track or the full cost of replacement whichever is greater.
760. When rails, which were second-hand when originally put in the line, are
replaced by new ones, the entire cost of replacement will be charged to the
Depreciation Reserve Fund.
761. Deleted
762. Deleted
763. Deleted
764. Renewals of Carriages and Brake-Vans- In the case of replacement of
carriages, one bogie should be taken as replacing two four-wheelers.
765. Renewals of Self-propelled Coaches- When self-propelled coaches are
replaced by locomotives, the Cost at debit of capital in respect of the carriage
portion will be written off from capital by debit to the Depreciation Reserve Fund and
the cost of replacement, allocated to the Depreciation Reserve Fund in accordance
with the provision of paragraphs 754, 755 and 758.
766. Renewals of wagons-In the case of replacement of wagons, one bogie
should be taken as replacing two 4-wheelers.
767. When new stock is built on old underframes, only the depreciated value of the
underframes should be included in the cost of the new stock and the same amount
being credited to the Depreciation Reserve Fund as value received for released
materials.
768. Renewals of Rolling Stock parts-The cost of renewals of complete wheels
and axles of carriages and wagons should be allocated to the Depreciation Reserve
Fund.
769. Deleted
21

770. When the motions, or in some cases the engine frames of locomotives, are
altered, the total cost is charged to Revenue.
771. When small fittings are provided for locomotives incidental to conversions, the
total cost is charged to Revenue.
772. Incidental Works-The allocation of temporary works and diversions, which
are incidental to a main work, follows that of the main work in connection with
which they are required, and where the main works are debitable partly to Capital or
the Development Fund etc and partly to the Depreciation Reserve Fund or Revenue,
their cost is allocated in rateable proportions.
773. The cost of incidental works which are not essential for the execution of the
main work, but are required merely to maintain the earning revenue of the railway
at their normal level is chargeable entirely to Revenue.
774. Incidental Charges -The cost of a work includes all charges directly
connected with the work. Accordingly the freight on materials to the site of work and
charges for loading and unloading, dismantlement, shifting and relaying form part of
the cost of the work to which they are directly incidental and are not separately
chargeable to Revenue.
775. Expenditure on Ceremonial Occasions -The expenditure incurred on
ceremonial occasions in connection with the opening of new lines or open line works
shall be charged to Revenue.
776. Cost of Tools and Plants and Special Posts -No portion of the pay or
allowances of permanent open line staff shall be charged to estimates, when such
staff is employed on special works and the vacancies thus caused in the open line
cadre remain unfilled. The cost (less return value) of tools and plant specially
purchased and the cost of any posts specially created, for the supervision or
construction of a work chargeable purely to Capital or Depreciation Reserve Fund
or Development Fund or Open Line Works-Revenue, is debited to Capital,
Depreciation Reserve Fund, Development Fund, as the case may be. Where the
cost of work is chargeable partly to Capital or Development Fund, or Depreciation
Reserve Fund, the cost of such posts and tools and plants should be allocated to
Capital or Development Fund or Depreciation Reserve Fund, in the same
proportion in which the estimate for the work excluding the estimated cost of
tools and plant and special posts, is chargeable. For working out the proportion,
the gross amount of the estimate (ignoring the provision for credits on account of
released materials) should be taken into account. The cost of a post, for the
22

purpose of this rule includes the leave salary and contributions towards passages,
pensions, provident fund, bonus and special contribution to provident fund, which
the holder of the post may be entitled to.
Note: The provision for credits on account of released materials to be ignored in
working out the proportion of cost of tools and plants and special posts, should be
the net credit in terms of paragraph 710 (2).
777. Inter-Railway Transfer of Assets -When locomotives and other rolling
stock are transferred from an Indian Railway to a railway other than Indian
Railways the Depreciation Reserve Fund of the selling railway should be debited
with the original cost of the stock by credit to Capital and the Depreciation Reserve
Fund credited with the depreciated value of the stock, by debit to the railway to
which the stock is transferred, the depreciated value being arrived at according to
the following formula
Then depreciated value (C) is:
Where-
a is the sum of the years the stock has run, six months or less to be
ignored and more than six months to count as one year;
b is the sum of the years of its normal life;
c is the original cost of the stock or present day replacement cost,
whichever is greater
Note (1) The value of any locomotive,carriage or wagon shall not be at any time
less than 25 percent of its original cost or present day replacement cost, whichever
is greater.
(2) The cost of an engine, when it is not known separately should be
calculated on the following basis :-
Cost of engine for tender/tank engine = ¾/⅔ of the original cost or present day
replacement cost, whichever is greater, of the whole locomotive.
778. The normal life of Rolling stock should, for the purposes of the preceding
rule be assumed to be as given under para 219, as modified from time to time.
779. The example given below illustrates the formula prescribed in paragraph 777-
Example.-An engine, the original cost of which is Rs 12 Cr is
transferred to another railway after it has run for six years.-
23

a = 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21.
b = 1+2+3................ 40 = 820
C= 12,00,00,000
= 12,00,00,000 - 2304878
= 11,76,95,122
780. When rolling stock is transferred from one Indian Railway to another such
railway, the original cost and the amount of depreciation, since purchase or since
last renewal if renewed, should both be transferred from the selling to the
purchasing railway without any financial adjustment, the cost of part renewals, if
any, actually charged to the Depreciation Reserve Fund being deducted before
transfer. The depreciation, for the purpose of this paragraph, should be calculated
on the basis of "normal life’’ as modified from time to time.
781. Assets other than Rolling Stock -When assets other than rolling stock are
transferred from one Indian Railway to another such railway, adjustments, where
necessary, will be made between the selling and the purchasing railways in
accordance with paragraphs 703 to 715, the sale value being the market value as
may be mutually settled between the railways parties to the transaction as in the
case of disposal or sale of assets.
782. Sale of overage or condemned locomotives and wagons -The sale
price of overaged or condemned locomotives and wagons shall be determined in
accordance with the following formula -
Locomotives- (a) Scrap value, on weight basis, at controlled rates, on the
ferrous portion. Virgin metal value, at present day prices, on non-ferrous
portion, e.g., copper, brass, etc.
The aggregate value thus arrived at, to be raised by 25 per cent.
(b) In addition to the sale price, calculated as above, a proportion of the cost
of periodical overhaul given to the locomotives prior to their sale, should also
be included therein. This should be determined in accordance with the
formula given below -
Average Kilometrage done by
Cost of kilometrage engine since last
periodical between 2 - periodical overhauls
overhaul X periodical
overhauls
24

Average kilometrage between 2 periodical
overhauls
Wagons- Scrap value at controlled rates excepting for serviceable parts e.g.,
wheels and axles, springs, draw gear, buffing gear, brake gear, etc., for which 50
percent of the present day prices should be added. The aggregate value thus
arrived at should be raised by 25 percent to arrive at the sale price.
Subject to the minimum as fixed above, the actual sale price should be settled in
each case depending on the working condition of the unit.
Note -This Formula relating to wagons does not apply to wagon bodies (i.e.
condemned wagons after stripping useful fittings) sold by auction.
783. Transfers of assets from ‘Open Line’ to 'Construction' -When an asset
borne at the debit of Capital or Development Fund or any other such fund is
transferred from Open Line to Construction, the original cost of the asset should be
written back from Capital or Development Fund or any other such fund to the
Depreciation Reserve Fund and the depreciated value of the asset deviated to the
construction estimate by credit to the Deprecation Reserve Fund.
784. Replaced Stock -Credits for Rolling stock, replaced but kept running on the
lines should be afforded to the Depreciation Reserve Fund only when the stock is
actually broken up or returned to the store depot or other wise disposed of.
785. When parts of an engine or vehicle which is borne on the “ replaced stock”
list, are to be used in construction of new stock, the present value of material so
used shall be included as part of the cost of the new stock, the Depreciation Reserve
Fund receiving credit to that extent.
786. The cost of all additions and alterations which may be required to be made in
the replaced stock to render it suitable for the purpose for which its retention was
intended, should be charged to revenue. Vehicles converted into those of a different
class do not come under this rule and incidence of the cost of conversion follows the
ordinary rules.
787. Second-hand Rails -When second-hand rails, released from
existing lines are supplied to new projects or other administrations,
their price is determined according the formula prescribed below: -
Price per ton = R - N/L ( R-S )
Where -
25

R. is the present day price of new rails of the section in questing
(exclusive of freight charges)
N. is the age of the rails;
L is the estimated life of the rail; and
S is the scrap value of the rail
L should be taken as prescribed but is subject to variation in cases where the
Chief Engineer considers that it is not a fair estimate of the life; and S should be
taken at 40 percent of the present day price of new rail unless there are special
reason to hold that, at the time of transfer of the rails, the value so arrived at
diverges considerably from the current market rates for such scrap when the value
may be fixed on the basis of rates obtained for large quantities at recent sales.
788. Private Railways worked by Indian Railways - The detailed rules in
foregoing paragraphs of this chapter are generally applicable to expenditure on
private lines worked by Indian Railways except in so far as they may be inconsistent
with the provisions of the contract between the Government and party owning the
railway, when the provision of the contract shall prevail. The important deviations
from rules in this chapter which the contracts generally provide for are—
a) Petty works, can be grouped together for the purpose of debiting the
aggregate cost of such works to capital when they are included in a group of
petty works, none of which can be carried out or is effective for the purpose
for which intended independently of the construction of others, or when the
works are connected by the same general idea and are undertaken at or
about the same time as a part of general scheme.
b) The cost of trial stations is charged to capital. It is written back to revenue if
the station is eventually abandoned.
c) The original cost of an abandoned work ordinarily remains at the debit of
capital. When the work is demolished or sold, Capital pays for the demolition
and receives credit for the sale proceeds or the value of the material
recovered, as the case may be. When assisted sidings are abandoned,
revenue is charged with any balance of the cost, which may remain at debit
of Capital after the sidings have been dismantled.

CHAPTER IX
Statutory Audit
901. Comptroller and Auditor General of India- Comptroller and Auditor
General of India is an authority sui generis created by the Constitution of India for
conducting audit of the accounts of the Union, the States and the Union Territories.
His functions are derived in the main from Articles 149 to 151 of the Constitution and
these have been further defined by the Comptroller and Auditor General's (Duties,
Powers and Conditions of Service) Act-1971 which came into force from 15th
December, 1971 and the amendment Act, 1976 which came into force from 1st
March, 1976. This enactment lays down in detail his duties, powers and conditions of
service. According to these Acts his duties are-
a) to audit all expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India and of each
State and of each Union Territory having a Legislative Assembly and to
ascertain, whether the moneys shown in the accounts as having been
disbursed were legally available for, and applicable to, the service or
purpose to which they have been applied or charged and whether the
expenditure conforms to the authority which governs it;
b) to audit all transactions of the union and of the States relating to
Contingency Funds and Public Accounts.
c) to audit all trading, manufacturing, profit and loss accounts and balance
sheets and other subsidiary accounts kept in any Department of the Union
or of a State and in each case to report on the expenditure, transactions
or accounts so audited by him.
902. It is also the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit all receipts
which are payable into the Consolidated Fund of India and of each State and of each
Union Territory having a Legislative Assembly and to satisfy himself that the rules and
procedures in that behalf are designed to secure an effective check on the
assessment, collection and proper allocation of revenue and are being duly observed
and to make for this purpose, such examination of the accounts as he thinks fit and
report thereon.
903. He also has authority to audit and report on the accounts of stores and stock
kept in any department of the Union or of a State.
904. He has, in connection with the performance of his duties, authority-
2

a) to inspect any office of accounts under the control of the Union or of a
State, including treasuries and such offices responsible for keeping of
Initial or subsidiary accounts, as submit accounts to him;
b) to require that any accounts, books, papers and other documents which
deal with or form the basis of or are otherwise relevant to the transactions
to which his duties in respect of audit extend, shall be sent to such place
as he may appoint for his inspection ;
c) to put such questions or make such observations as he may consider
necessary to the person in charge of the office and to call for such
information as he may require for preparation of any account or report.
905. The Act of 1971 read with amendment Act, 1976 also contains provisions
about audit by Comptroller and Auditor General of authorities and bodies substantially
financed from the revenues of the Union or States or the Union Territories. It also
specifies his functions in the case of grants or loans to outside authorities or bodies. It
also provides for entrustment to him of audit of accounts of authorities or bodies by
the President, the 'Governor of a State or the Administrator of a Union Territory
subject to certain conditions. His duties and powers in relation to audit of the
accounts of Government companies are defined in the Companies Act 1956. He
conducts audit of the accounts of Corporations established by or under law made by
Parliament in accordance with the provisions of the respective enactments.
906. Under Article 150 of the Constitution, the accounts of Union and State
Governments shall be kept in such forms as the Comptroller and Auditor General of
India may, with the, approval of the President, prescribe. Article 279 of the
Constitution provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General of India shall
ascertain and certify the "net proceeds" of any tax or duty collected by the
Government of India but which are assigned partly or in full to the States in terms of
Part XII of the Constitution of India.
907. His oath of office requires him to uphold the Constitution and the laws and to
discharge his duties without fear or favour, affection or ill-will. The Constitution
safeguards the independence and freedom of the Comptroller and Auditor General in
a variety of ways. Article 148 of the Constitution provides that the Comptroller and
Auditor General shall be appointed by the President under his hand and seal and
shall only be removed from office in like manner and on the like ground as a Judge
of the Supreme Court. It also provides that he would not be eligible for any other
office either under the Government of India or the Government of any State and
that the administrative expenses of his office, including all salaries, allowances and
pensions payable to or in respect of persons serving in that office, shall be charged
3

upon the Consolidated Fund of India.
908. The scope and extent of audit are determined by the Comptroller and
Auditor General at his discretion.
909. Railway Accounts- Separation from Audit -As stated in para 104, the
process of separation of accounting and auditing functions on the Railways was
completed in 1929 as a sequel to one of the recommendations of the Acworth
Committee. Under this arrangement, the Comptroller and Auditor-General has been
relieved of the responsibility for compiling the accounts of Railway department. His
responsibility for statutory audit of the accounts of Indian Railways is the same as
that for the other departments of the Government of India.
910. Director of Railway Audit -The responsibility of the Comptroller and Auditor
General for audit of Railway accounts is discharged through the Deputy Comptroller
and Auditor-General of India (Railways) who conducts the audit on behalf of and
under the direction of Comptroller and Auditor General. He is assisted by Principal
Director of Audit posted at head-quarters of the Zonal Railways/Production Units.
911. One important object of statutory audit for the Railways is to ensure that the
system of accounts adopted and used in the Accounts Department of the Railways is
suitable and that the check by the internal check mechanism is sufficient, that the
accounts are maintained and the checks applied with accuracy and that
arrangements exist in the Railways Accounts offices to ensure attention to the
financial interests of Railways. This object is secured by a test check applied to
the vouchers and connected accounts records of the Accounts Department and by
inspections on the spot of initial records and documents in the offices in which the
transactions originate. The Railway officers should afford all facilities to statutory
Audit officers in the discharge of their duties.
912. The Deputy Comptroller and Auditor-General of India (Railways), is responsible
for scrutinising the adequacy and suitability of all instructions governing compilation
of the accounts of Railways and the internal check procedures, whether those
instructions be in the form of Codes or otherwise. He is to satisfy himself that such
instructions are consistent with the relevant statutory rules and facilitate conduct of
an effective audit thereof. He is also responsible for scrutinising the Railway portion
of the Finance Accounts of the Union Government including Annual Review of
Balances Compiled by the Railway Board (Accounts). He also examines the
Appropriation Accounts prepared by the Railway Board for certifying their accuracy
and prepares the Audit Report (Union Government-Railways) of the Comptroller and
4

Auditor – General of India.
913. The Deputy Comptroller and Auditor-General (Railways) is responsible for audit
of-
i) sanctions, having financial effect, accorded by Government of India
other than those pertaining solely to an individual railway or railway
accounts office;
ii) sanctions regarding financial rules and general orders issued by the
President which are not of) a general nature but are applicable exclusively
to the Railway Department ;
iii) tenders invited and accepted by the Railway Board for purchase of
materials; and
iv) accounts maintained in the office of the Railway Board (Accounts Branch).
914. The Principal Director of Audit of a Railway is responsible for detailed audit of
the accounts of that Railway and for conducting inspections of the records of the
various offices of that Railway. This responsibility extends to all expenditure and
receipts of that Railway whether under construction organization or open to traffic
and to the account of stores, stock and manufacture. He audits inter alia (1) the
financial sanctions, pertaining to his Railway and offices under his audit, accorded by
the various Railway authorities, (2) allocation of estimates sanctioned by those
authorities, (3) general orders issued by the General Manager, (4) all sanctions
pertaining to local traffic, (5) sanctions issued by the Railway Administration relating
to interchange traffic between two railways.
915. The cost of Railway audit is borne by the Railway revenues and is debited to
Major Heads-3001 “Indian Railways-Policy Formulation Direction Research and other
Miscellaneous Organisations, Annexure-D":-
Annexure ‘D’ – Reimbursement of cost of Railway Budget
Audit Estimate
Cost of Railway Audit Offices ----
Deputy Comptroller and Auditor General of India ----
(Charged)
Total - Annexure ‘D’ ----
The cost of the Railway audit wing of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-
General is treated as charged expenditure in accordance with Article 112 (3) of the
Constitution. Payments of all charges relating to Railway audit offices are made by
5

the Railway Accounts Officers (of the respective Railways) who function as treasury
officers and accounting officers for expenditure of the Railway Audit Department
and exercise such checks as are prescribed from time to time by the Ministry of
Railways in consultation with the Deputy Comptroller and Auditor-General of India
(Railways).
916. Communications from Audit - Ordinarily, the results of statutory audit are
communicated through-
1) Specific reports of the more important and serious irregularities
discovered in the course of audit of accounts and departmental
offices and station records.
2) Audit notes detailing minor irregularities discovered in the course
of audit of accounts office records.
3) Inspection reports showing the results of audit of the initial records
of executive offices and stations.
Note -A record of petty objections not formally raised is also maintained by
Principal Director of Audit and sent periodically, as may be arranged, to the
Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer for scrutiny and review.
917. Disposal of Audit Objections -All audit objections and notes should be
promptly attended to by the Accounts Officer. Audit objections may either relate to
matters which can be disposed of by the Accounts Officer himself without reference to
the executive or to matters which can be elucidated only by the executive. In the
former case, no reference should ordinarily be made by the Accounts Officer to the
executive except to advise disallowances, if any, arising out of the audit objections.
For the latter, the Accounts Officer should arrange to elicit necessary information for
disposal of the audit objection; and if in his opinion, the audit objection should be
upheld, he should arrange to see that suitable action is taken. The Accounts Officer
should generally take the same action on defects and irregularities brought to
notice by the Principal Director of Audit as he would take if they had been discovered
in the course of internal check exercised in his own organisation.
918. Audit Notes and Inspections Reports -An inspection report consists of
two parts, Part I dealing with the more important matters and Part II dealing with the
rest, containing minor routine matters. Audit notes detailing the results of monthly
test-audit similarly consists of two parts and should be dealt with by the departments
and accounts officers without delay.
The final disposal of Part II of the audit notes and inspection reports, whether on the
6

accounts or executive offices, rests with the Accounts Officer, and no formal reply to
the Principal Director of Audit is necessary. The disposal of such audit notes and
inspection reports should, however, be made available to the Principal Director of
Audit.
Replies to Part I of inspection reports and audit notes and specific reports on the
more important irregularities should be sent to the Principal Director of Audit as soon
as possible showing clearly the action taken thereon.
A record of the specific reports, audit notes Parts I and II and inspection reports,
Parts I and II received from audit and dealt with or outstanding should be kept and
reviewed periodically to ensure their prompt disposal. The connected records on
which objections have been raised should not be destroyed till the objections are
settled.
919. Replies to Inspection Reports - Replies to inspection reports of executive
offices should be send by those offices to the Accounts Officer. In scrutinizing them,
the Accounts Officer should call for further information, if necessary, and consult the
head of the division or department, where desirable, before giving a reply to the
Principal Director of Audit. The Accounts Officer should, in giving replies to the
communications to the Principal Director of Audit, act in close collaboration with the
administrative authorities concerned, so that the information given to audit may be an
authoritative statement of facts on behalf of the Railway Administration, and there
may be no possibility of any dispute at a later stage.
920. Disagreement between the Accounts Officer and the Principal
Director of Audit -If the Accounts Officer is unable to accept the views of the
Principal Director of Audit, he should, if requested by the latter, make a reference
to the General Manager. When making such a reference, the Accounts Officer
should send a verbatim copy of the Principal Director of Audit's objection and a
statement of his own views. The General Manager should be requested to obtain the
orders of the Railway Board if the matter is beyond his Competence to decide.
However, when the question is one of accounts procedure, the matter should be
referred to the Railway Board.
921. Audit Objections and Provisional Payments -If the Principal Director of
Audit objects to any payments of a recurring nature and it is considered necessary to
continue them pending settlement of the objection, they may, if the objection is not
on ground of violation of a law or a statutory rule, be made provisionally and
subject to recovery, the payee being so informed. Unless there are strong reasons
7

to the contrary in the view of the Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer and
the General Manager, if the audit view appears to be prima facie acceptable to the
Accounts Officer, he should act upon the audit objection provisionally pending receipt
of formal orders from higher authorities, if necessary. Under this procedure, where it
is considered necessary to continue the payments, these should be treated as
provisional and action taken to get the objection answered satisfactorily as early as
possible.
922. Rectification of mistakes in Accounts disclosed by Audit -If the audit
scrutiny discloses any inaccuracy in the accounts compiled by the Accounts Officer the
following procedure, which is equally applicable to mistakes detected in-internal
check, should be adopted:-
1) If the accounts of the year have not been finally closed, the mistake should be
rectified through the accounts of the month in hand.
2) Mistakes and misclassifications noticed after the March accounts have been closed
should be rectified before the Capital & Revenue Accounts and Finance Accounts
are prepared and intimated to the Railway Board by the first week of August either
through a revised account or through corrections to accounts already submitted.
3) Mistakes and misclassifications noticed after the submission of the Capital &
Revenue and Finance Accounts should be dealt with in accordance with the
following rules :-
a) No correction need be made, if the item properly belongs to one revenue
or service head but is wrongly classified under another, a suitable note
against the original entry being sufficient. If, however, the error affects the
revenue or expenditure of another railway, or a branch line company or
another Government Department or a capital head outside the Revenue
Account or a debt or remittance head, it must be corrected.
b) If the corrections, or transfers affect capital major heads, unless they affect
the accounts of different Governments or represent readjustment of less
important misclassifications of a previous year, they should usually be
effected by altering the progressive figure of capital outlay without financial
adjustment i.e. , without passing the debit and credit entries through the
accounts of the year’s financial transactions. This would prevent
unnecessary inflation of the current year's accounts and the voting of
grants which the inclusion of the correcting entries in the current accounts
8

would otherwise involve.
c) If the error affects a debt or remittance head, the procedure should be as
follows:
i) Item taken to one debt or remittance head instead of another :- The
correction should be made by transferring it from the one to the
other. Such corrections affecting the heads for which grants are
obtained should be made as plus credit or minus credit under the
heads concerned, instead of as minus debit or plus debit.
ii) Item credited to a debt or remittance head instead of a revenue head,
or debited to a debt or remittance head instead of to a service head.
The correction should be made by transferring it to the head under
which it should originally appear.
iii) Item credited or debited to a revenue head instead of to a debt or
remittance head- The correction should be made by minus crediting
or minus debiting the revenue head and crediting or debiting the
proper head.
4) If the rectification of a mistake would lead to an excess over a grant or grants
voted by the Parliament or an appropriation sanctioned by the President or to a
considerable change in the dividend payable during the year to general revenues,
the orders of the Member Finance, Railway Board must be first obtained.
923. Audit Report-Railways -The Deputy Comptroller and Auditor- General of
India (Railways) is responsible for preparation of the Report of the Comptroller and
Auditor-General of India, Union Government (Railways) which also includes comments
on the Appropriation Accounts of Railways compiled by Ministry of Railways (Railway
Board).
924. All important cases coming to notice of Audit during inspections or regular audit
which, in the opinion of the Principal Director of Audit, merit inclusion in the Report of
the Comptroller and Auditor-General are, ordinarily, brought to the notice of the
Railway Administrations through special letters, notes of objection or factual
statements issued to the Heads of Departments/Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts
Officers by the Principal Director of Audit of the Railways. The Railway
Administrations should take up with promptitude the scrutiny of the facts brought
out therein and send their replies to the Principal Director of Audit within the time
prescribed for the purpose. Since these special letters, factual statements, etc., form
the basis of the material for the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the
9

Railway Administrations should deal with them at a sufficiently high level and bring
out their point of view in a convincing manner so that the Principal Director of Audit
may have the full presentation of the Railway's case before they proceed to
prepare a draft paragraph for incorporation in the Audit Report.
925. The Principal Director of Audit sends the draft paragraphs to the General
Manager. He also sends simultaneously advance copies of the draft paragraphs with
connected correspondence, to the Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer, the
Head of the Department concerned, the Deputy Comptroller and Auditor-General of
India (Railways) and the Director (Accounts), Railway Board to facilitate prompt
action and detailed examination of the points brought out in the draft paragraph. The
General Manager should send the reply to the draft paragraph to the Principal
Director of Audit, duly approved by the Ministry of Railways (Railway Board), if the
draft para involves more than one Railway/Unit, within eight weeks, simultaneously
endorsing copies to the Deputy Comptroller and Auditor-General of India (Railways),
and Director, Accounts (Railway Board). To enable the Railway Board to approve the
draft reply prepared by the Railway Administration, the General Manager should
furnish the following additional information to the Railway Board along with the
proposed reply to draft paragraph :-
i) A history of the case with copies of relevant correspondence not covered in the
Principal Director of Audit's letter.
ii) Sentence-wise comments on the draft para specifically verifying /correcting the
facts and figures quoted therein.
iii) A chronological summary of the case where there has been unusual delay in
dealing with the subject matter.
iv) Remedial action called for or taken to avoid similar cases in future.
v) Disciplinary aspects where individual lapses have been brought to light.
Any aspects which the Railway Administration, may wish the Principal Director of
Audit to consider before sending the final reply should, as far as possible, be settled
by personal discussions so that the time limit may not be exceeded.
In cases where the cause of audit objection and the remedial/corrective measures are
within the control of an individual Railway, General Manager of Zonal Railways/PUs
are authorized to send replies to Draft paras after vetting by Railway’s Finance
directly to the Principal Director of Audit. In such cases, the reply to the draft paras
should be sent to Audit within six weeks.
926. Draft paragraphs on matters arising from the scrutiny of Railway Board's
contracts, schemes and sanctions etc., are issued by the Deputy Comptroller and
10

Auditor-General of India (Railways) addressed to the Railway Board. In such cases the
material which is required to be furnished by the Principal Director of Audit of
Railways to the Deputy Comptroller and Auditor-General of India (Railways) should be
vetted promptly by the Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer of Railways, when
they are requested to do so. Enquiries, if any, made by the Deputy Comptroller and
Auditor-General of India (Railways) for further information should be given high
priority and, as far as possible, such information should be supplied promptly to the
Principal Director of Audit by the Railway Administrations duly vetted by the Financial
Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer for onward transmission to the Deputy Comptroller
and Auditor-General of India (Railways). The Deputy Comptroller and Auditor-General
of India (Railways) will send the edited paragraphs to the Railway Board for
verification of facts and clarification on any point which the Railway Board may like to
give before the paragraph is finalised by the Deputy Comptroller and Auditor General
of India (Railways) for inclusion in the Report. A time-limit is usually specified within
which the Railway Board are expected to complete the factual verification or offer
their comments on these revised/edited paragraphs. These revised paragraphs
should, on receipt by the Railway Board/Railway Administration, be scrutinized
promptly with utmost care as it is not possible to correct any factual inaccuracies in
the draft paragraphs at a later stage.
927. The Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India is presented to the
Parliament, generally during the Budget session, where it is taken up for consideration
by the Public Accounts Committee consisting of members of Lok Sabha and Rajya
Sabha. The Committee obtains personal evidence of senior officers of the Railway
Board in respect of the various items in the comptroller and Auditor General’s Report.
The results of the deliberations of the Public Accounts Committee are published in the
form of Reports which are laid on the table of each House of Parliament and
forwarded to the Ministry of Railways (Railway Board). These Reports contain the
recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee for implementation by the
Ministry of Railways.
928. The recommendations made by the Public Accounts Committee are considered
by the Ministry of Railways (Railway Board), and other Ministries of Government of
India, where, some of the observations and recommendations concern them also, and
notes on action taken on the Public Accounts Committee's recommendations are
submitted to the Committee, along with any comments which Audit department may
have to make on these notes, within six months of the date of presentation of the
Reports.
929. Internal Audit- Focus -Traditionally, the focus of internal audit has been on
11

compliance of rules, regulations, policies and procedures. As is evident from the role
assigned to the Internal Audit Wings in the “Redefined Charter for Financial Advisors”
issued by Ministry of Finance on June 1, 2006, the remit of Internal Audit has been
enlarged. While Compliance Audit remains important, internal auditors are now
expected to focus on evaluation of controls with reference to the risks and to provide
an assurance to the Management that the controls are functioning in the intended
manner and hence there is a reasonable assurance that the goals and objectives of
Ministry/Department will be achieved. Through this, Internal Audit contributes to the
efforts to strengthen governance processes in Ministries/Departments.
930. Internal Audit Process: The internal audit process comprises of five action
phases. 1. Planning the audit engagement. 2. Preparing for Audit. 3. Performing the
audit engagement. 4. Reporting upon the audit engagement; and 5. Follow up action.
931. A typical internal audit assignment involves the following steps: 1) Establish and
communicate the scope and objectives for the audit to appropriate
management/authorities. 2) Develop an understanding of the operational area under
review. This includes objectives, measurements and key transaction types. This
involves review of documents and interaction with the auditee. Flowcharts and
narratives may be created if necessary. 3) Describe the risks facing the business
activities within the scope of the audit. 4) Identify control procedures used to ensure
each key risk and transaction type is properly controlled and monitored. 5) Develop and
execute a risk based sampling and testing approach to determine whether the most
important controls are operating as intended. 6) Report problems identified and review
action plans with management to address the problems.7) Follow-up on reported
findings at appropriate intervals for which Internal Audit departments must maintain a
follow up database.
932. Internal audit is a concurrent process and may not involve the detailed audit
process, unless it is a specific theme based audit, undertaken as a special audit. By
analyzing and recommending business improvements in critical areas, auditors help the
organization to meet its objective. In addition to assessing business processes,
Information Technology (IT), Auditors also review information controls.
